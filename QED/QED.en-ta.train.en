That is, a change of one unit in x corresponds to a change of 0.4 units in y.
2f times this thing right over here. Is that equivalent to that over there? Well, it doesn't look like it's going to be.
So the least common multiple is going to be 40. It's going to be 40. Now, to go from 8 to 40, you have to multiply by 5.
And we want to tell our grandchildren that there was a terrible time in history where up to a third of the children had brains and bodies that were stunted, but that exists no more. Thank you.
So we already are going into this scenario. But you're like hey, so I don't see 13 equals 13.
1 times 4 is 4. And then we add the two.
So 5 divided by 4. You want to have all the decimals there, so let's put some zeroes out here.
So you're going to be left with 63. And now we have to subtract: 633 - 6.
So if I want to find the area, the area of ABCD, the whole parallelogram. It's going to be equal to the area of triangle ADC plus the area of CBA. But the area of CBA is the same thing as the area of ADC.
It goes into it 7 times.
5 goes into 40 eight times.
Well, 0.05 times 1,000 is equal to 50, right?
So, Napoleon took it back. Except, hold on a second - because we're not in the Louvre. We're in London, in the British Museum.
35 times 8. 5 times 8 is 40, 3 times 8 is 24, plus 4 is 28.
Actually, let me do it up here, I think I'm about to run out of space-- 95 times 0.15. five times five is twenty-five, nine times five is forty-five plus two is forty-seven, one times ninety-five is ninety-five, bring down the five, twelve, carry the one, fifteen. And how many decimals do we have? one, two.
10 to the second power, I was going to say the "twoth" power. 10 to the second power has two 2 0's Finally, 10 to the third has three 0's. Don't want to beat a dead horse here, but I think you get the idea.
Minus 224. Did I do that right? I don't want to make a careless mistake?
10/3 is 3 and 1/3, so it might sit-- let me do it in a different color. It might be over here. We're not going to include that.
5 times 8 is 40, 40 minus 40 is 0, bring down another 0.
No matter how they got there, those people who get there became the ancestors of today's Americans.
This 9 in the ten's place- well that represents 90 or 9 times 10, or 9 times 1 plus 9
Notice, we have 1 is the numerator, 3 is the denominator, and we just said that this is equal to the numerator divided by the denominator. 1 over 3 is the same thing as 1 divided by 3. Is this always true for a fraction?
Making some assumptions and then deducing other things from those assumptions.
Or the absolute value of -9, that is also equal to 9. When you think of it visually, that is because both of these numbers are exactly 9 away from 0. This is 9 to the right of 0 and this is 9 to the left of 0.
And let's say ten x -- let's multiply this by ten. So ten x is equal to twelve point two repeating. Which is the same thing as twelve point two two two on and on and on.
Negative 16 is the same thing as minus 48 over 3, or negative 48 over 3. If you take 48 divided by 3 you'll get 16, and I'm just keeping the negative sign. And then you add that plus 1/3.
And they said, "Well, there's something similar about this opening here and this opening here." Or they might have asked themselves,
This is 2 times 196. That's right.
What was the time that it took Ussain Bolt to run the 100 meters, and I'll give you another few seconds to think about that.
Then a 1 divided by negative 4, is negative 1/4. So going back to the two equations, what do you notice? Well, when you put them in slope-intercept form, they both have the exact same slope, 5/4. but they have different y-intercepts.
And then I'm also going to copy it for block 2, to match that second goal block. So I'm going to try to get something that's 5/8, and I'm also going to try to get something that's 1 and 3/4. Now 3/4 is the same thing as 6/8.
Well, we already know that 18/6 is the same thing as 18 divided by 6, or 3.
But let's bring another 0 down.
- because you're giving it 10 more 10's. You're giving it a 100.
Let's add these two mixed numbers two and five thirteenths plus seven and six thirteenths and the way I like to think about it in my head, I like to separate out the mixed numbers in to the whole number component and the fractional component so we can rewrite two and five thirteenths as, two plus five over thirteen and then, we can write that plus, then seven and six thirteenths we can rewrite as plus seven plus six thirteenths
So a lot of people's reflex might just be, oh, let me take twenty percent. It becomes 0.20. And multiply it times four.
Why does sweating cool you down? That is an excellent question LeBron, and to answer it, let's zoom in on a little droplet of sweat. And sweat is mostly water, so when we zoom in, and we've really zoomed in, even more than I've drawn over here.
0.6 goes into 12-- let's add some decimal points here-- that's the same thing as 6 going into 120.
If we divide the numerator and the denominator by 5, we get minus 3/14.
Or his age today. Please forgive my handwriting.
(Laughter) Yes, I would love to have Sophia Loren's long legs and legendary breasts. But given a choice, I would rather have the warrior hearts of Wangari Maathai, Somaly Mam, Jenny and Rose Mapendo.
["John Adams" by David McCullough] -- who are involved in the same event, or friends with shared experiences.
And so how old was William 12 years ago? If he's '4B' right now, 12 years ago it would be 12 less than that. 12 years ago it would be '4B - 12'
And let's also try 291 times 6. Let's figure out what that is So 291 times 6
5 times 3 is 15. Subtract, no remainder.
So 2 is a prime number. It's only divisible by 1 and 2.
Let's try some little more complicated equations. Let's say we have 3 times x plus 5-- I want to make sure I get all the colors nice-- is equal to 17. So what's different about this than what we saw in the last video is, all of a sudden, now we have this plus 5.
And I have all my non-powers of 10 right over there. And so I can simplify it. If I have the same base 10 right over here, so I can add the exponents.
I have here a bunch of radical expressions, or square root expressions. And what I'm going to do is go through all of them and simplify them. And we'll talk about whether these are rational or irrational numbers.
And actually, theoretically, I've read-- my own abilities don't go this far-- there could be such a thing as a magnetic monopole, although it has not been observed yet in nature. So everything we've seen in nature has been a dipole. So you could just keep cutting this up, all the way down to if it's just one electron left.
And we bring the zero here, it's ninety-five, one times five, one times nine, then we add five plus zero is five, seven plus five is twelve-- oh. See? I made a mistake.
So we're starting - draw a number line - so we're starting at negative 7 and then...
But he key here is, is when we square this, so 6.7 squared, so let's, 6.7 squared guys. 44.89 which is eleven hundredths, eleven hundredths away from 45.
Well, 75 is an odd number, or the number in the ones place, this 5, is an odd number.
(Laughter) (Applause) You know, to me, human communities depend upon a diversity of talent, not a singular conception of ability. And at the heart of our challenges -- (Applause)
Since 7/7 is equal to 1, 2/5 times 7 is equal to 2/5 times 1. Well, obviously, 2/5 times 7 is not the same thing as 2/5 times 1. So this is kind of nutty.
What happens if we have a to the b times a to the 0? Well, by this property, this needs to be equal to a to the b plus 0, which is equal to a to the b. So a to the b times a to the 0 must be equal to a to the b.
2.2 pounds per 1 kilogram. And you know this'll work out, because you have a pound in the numerator and you have a pound in the denominator. It's called dimensional analysis.
So you have a remainder of 31 291 cannot go into 31 any more. So that's our remainder But how many times does it actually go into this big beastly number?
One, two, three, four, five, six. So this number times 7 is clearly equal to the number that we started off with. So we can rewrite this number.
(Laughter) I guess you can see this is lots of different types of cameras: it's everything from cell-phone cameras to professional SLRs, quite a large number of them, stitched together in this environment. If I can find some of the sort of weird ones --
Two times two to the eighth. That's just two to the eighth plus itself.
So if that's the center of the circle, and if we make this ray our starting point or one side of our angle, if you go all the way around the circle, that represents 360 degrees. And the notation is 360, and then this little superscript circle represents degrees. This could be read as 360 degrees.
A bouquet of 12 daisies costs $11. The equation describes the relationship between the number of daisies, x, and their price at Flora's Flowers, y. So let's look at scenario A.
The question is saying show us 109% by shading. We already did 100 per 100, but we need to do another 9, so let's shade in another 9. So now we have one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine.
So it's 2 times 100, which is 2 times 50, which is 2 times 25, which is 5 times 5. So this right here, we can rewrite it. Let me scroll to the right a little bit.
291 times 3 So I could do this in my head or I could just make sure I don't make a mistake Let me do it right over here
If 150 is 25% of some number, that means 150 should be 1/4 of that number. It should be a lot smaller than that number, and it is.
1, 2, 3, 4, 5. But, like I said, if the original thing was equal to the original thing on the right, if we get rid of five objects from the left-hand side, we have to get rid of five objects from the right-hand side. So we have to do it here, too:
Well, it's going to be equal to this distance down here, which is 7 centimeters, plus this distance over here which is 4 centimeters, plus the distance on the top -- this is a rectangle, it's going to be the same distance as this one over here.
So in order to find the least common multiple, we don't have a 5 in the prime factorization of 64. We have the 2 times 2 times 2. So to get there, the least common multiple of these will be if we just multiply this times 5.
That is going to be 50 plus 20 is 70, plus 10 is 80, plus 5 is 85 plus 1 is 86. So there we have it. It went into it 86 times with a remainder of 12.
You know, you take the absolute value of negative 6, that's only 6 away from 0.
6 times negative m is minus 6m. And notice, I could have just said, times negative 6, and have a plus here, but I'm doing it in two steps. I'm doing the 6 first, and then I'll do the negative 1.
-100 means there is a lack of something.
Now, let me give you a little bit of intuition of why this works. Let's say I said 2 divided by 1/3. Well, we know that this is equal to 2/1 times 3/1, which equals 6.
X equals 100 divided by 1.25, so we say 1.25 goes into 100.00-- I'm going to add a couple of 0's, I don't know how many I'm going to need, probably added too many-- if I move this decimal over two to the right, I need to move this one over two to the right.
So we get 2y=y, and then we have minus 4 plus 7 so y+3, we can subtract y from both sides of this equation. The left hand side -- 2y-y is just y. y is equal to-- these cancel out; y is equal to three. And then we can go back and substitute into either of these equations and solve for x.
And, 4/8, so that's 32. Plus 1 is 33. 62 00:03:16,95 --&gt; 00:03:20,75 And now we divide this number by 4.
Now, if President Obama invited me to be the next Czar of Mathematics, then I would have a suggestion for him that I think would vastly improve the mathematics education in this country. And it would be easy to implement and inexpensive. The mathematics curriculum that we have is based on a foundation of arithmetic and algebra.
2 plus 16, and all that to the negative 2. And now we're almost done. We can once again use this multiplication rule, and we could say 3-- this is equal to 3 to the eighteen times negative 2, so that's 3 to the minus 36.
Please, don't try this at home. (Laughter) In a related German study, researchers used fMRI imaging to measure brain activity before and after injecting Botox to suppress smiling muscles.
In the year 1944, computers weighed as much as 4500 kilograms. A modern laptop weighs around 2.7 kilograms.
What I want to do in this video is think about the difference between a line segment (a line segment) a line (a line), and a ray (and a ray). And this is kind of the pure geometrical versions of these, of these, things. And so a line segment is actually probably what most of us associate with a line in our everyday lives.
properly, 6.022 times 10 to the 23rd, times 7.23 times 10 to the minus 22. We can change the order. So it's equal to 6.022 times 7.23.
Let's do a slightly harder one. Let's say we have 5x is greater than 8x plus 27.
To get 180 from 15, multiply 15 by 12--1510 = 150, 30 remaining for 180. 152 = 30.
We were able to already answer some interesting questions about the different plans at super yoga studio, using the equations we set up. But I'm a very visual guy. I wanna make sure I analyze the problem fully before I spend my hard earned dollars.
I'm drawing it as exact as I can with my hand. But let's just assume these are 5 equal sections. So what would you think would be a good label for this number right over here?
80 is 100% of 80.
&gt;&gt; So you see it's exciting in any language that you might watch it. But my question to you is how fast was Ussain Bolt going? What was his average speed when he ran that 100 meters right there?
Now, why did I only have to add 5 and not 6? Well, they shared a common wall here so I didn't have to add another toothpick here for this left-hand side wall. So starting with the first house,
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven. Let me put some commas here so we make it a little bit more readable. Or another way of talking about it is that it is, 1 times 10 to the seventh, is the same thing as 10 million.
Let's look at scenario C. And I will do scenario C in orange.
8 over 5. I multiplied by 8 over 5 so that those cancel out and those cancel out. And you are left with s is equal to-- right, this is just a 1-- is equal to-- well, the 5's we can divide.
So each of these quantities, it looks like we have expressions inside of absolute value signs. and just as a bit of review, absolute value just means your distance from zero. Or, another way to think about it is if it's a negative number inside of the absolute value sign, it becomes positive. If it's already positive, it stays positive.
It's just got to be like 1.2 liters. I guess the solution is water.
The 7(3y - 5). We just have to distribute the "7". So, this is gonna be 7 times 3y, which is going to give us 21y,
4 is the same thing as 8/2. That's the same thing as 4. And then you have that plus 1/2.
So we get a 2 times 5 right over there, 2 times 5 is 10. That is 10. So our whole expression becomes...
3 to the negative sixth power is equal to 1 over 3 to the sixth power. And I'm going do many, many more examples of this in the next video. But if you take anything to the negative power, so a to the negative b power is equal to 1 over a to the b.
They realized that, in 6,000 years of storytelling, they've gone from depicting hunting on cave walls to depicting Shakespeare on Facebook walls. And this was a cause for celebration. The art of storytelling has remained unchanged.
So this is a compound inequality. We have two conditions here. So z can satisfy this OR z can satisfy this over here.
This would be 2 years ago.
(Applause) That round of applause is actually for the doctors and nurses of the hospital who took care of Avelile. And I take it that you appreciate that kind of transformation.
I can write over here 4 times 99- I'll write what's like a different notation plus the 9 times the 9, that's those two terms and then we have the plus 4 plus 9 plus 8 Well, can we now tell whether this is divisible by 3? These terms, these first two terms are definitely divisible by 3
We can look, obviously A,D is equal to B,C.
"I'm a computer scientist." No, no, if I want to, I can say, "I'm a novelist."
So we're really trying to figure out, what is the y-coordinate when x equals 0?
Eight goes into seventeen two times. Two times eight is sixteen.
That tube on the inside is going to have this kind of finger-like projections and this finger-like projections are called villi, so this is a villus. I'll write the plural term which is villi and I'll just make this arrow pointed two of them so you understand that that's the plural term. The villi, what they do is they increase the surface area for absorption of all of those important nutrients that are going to be found in the lumen.
And if Tarush is fivex today, then Tarush would be fivex minus eighty-five. I just subtracted eighty-five from the current age. Because we're going eighty-five years in the past.
60 goes into 300 5 times.
Everything will shake!
And the treasures that are within you don't follow the ordinary economics and its laws. They are just the very opposite, diametrically opposite to the ordinary economic
5 times 3 is 15, plus 2 is 17. Put a 0 here, get rid of that thing. 3 times 5 is 15.
If I put-- I don't know-- 157 times 1, that'll be 157. I think you get the idea.
5 minus 4 is 1, 1 minus 1 is zero.
It is 55, and it is miles per hour. So his speed is 55 miles per hour. Now, this guy, this is pretty straightforward.
Now, any number that's divisible by 20, needs to be divisible by Let's take it's prime factorization 2 times 10, 10 is 2 times 5 so any number divisible by 20, needs to also be divisible by 2 times 2 times 5 or another way of thinking about it, it needs to have two 2's, and a 5 in it's prime factorization
What troubled me was that this top-down approach is still around. Now, don't get me wrong, we need money.
Problem 10 right there. So we have a minus 4b in the numerator, if you can read it, it's kind of small. a is minus 3. So we have minus 3-- or negative 3-- minus 4 times b. b is 2.
let me draw with some lines if I have one line like this and I have another line like that a right angle over here actually all of these would have to be right angles it would mean that this line is completely, if this line were the ground, this line is completely upright relative to this line over here. so either these, so that is what a right angle means so now that we defined right angle
Some really important things happen in the duodenum or the duodenum as it's sometimes called. What happens there is that the liver secretes a chemical called bile. That bile is stored sometimes when it's not needed immediately.
Here's a little clip of something I think I did poorly. Advise me -- when this kid acted up, how should I have dealt with that?" And they could all sit and work together on those problems.
All right, next video.
Well, we could rewrite 12 as-- so this is equal to-- we could rewrite 12 as 3 plus 3 plus 3 plus 3 over the yellow 3. Let me do it like this so I don't have to keep switching colors. This is going to be the same thing as 3/3 plus 3/3 plus 3/3 plus 3/3.
Namaskaram. Please play it.
B, we have the square root of 24. So what you want to do, is you want to get the prime factorization of this number right here.
What expression can be used to show dividing 18 boxes into two equals stacks? Find the expression three times using different ways to write division. Find the value of the expression.
-1 times the cube root, the cube root of 8 times 8 times 8 So we are asking the question What number can we multiply by itself 3 times
Vulnerability is not weakness. I define vulnerability as emotional risk, exposure, uncertainty. It fuels our daily lives.
The whole reason why we subtracted 6 from the right was to get rid of this 6 minus 6 is 0, so you have 12 is equal to 2y 2 times the number of years it will take Is 12, and you can probably solve this in your head But if we just want a one coefficient here we divide by 2 on the right
1.3 times 20, minus 0.7, times 20. Let's verify that that is equal to 12. So I'll take the calculator out, just so you don't have to trust my math.
Identify each number in the left column with its opposite in the right column
And when you multiply this guy-- and actually our change in y here is negative-- you're going to get this vector right here. So when you add those together you'll get your change in your actual position vector. So that was all a little bit of background.
Let's see if we can figure out what 30% of 6 is.
If I have negative 19/21, its inverse is just going to be you swap the numerator and the denominator.
(Laughter) And I said, "Why?" And he said, "Because you say to reach out, tell our story, be vulnerable.
1 over 3 to the third power, which would be equal to, well 1 over 3 times 3 or you could say 1 over 3 times 3 times 3, or 1 times 3 times 3 times 3, is going to be 27. So this is going to be 1 27th. Let's try another example.
I just multiplied by the inverse of negative 4/9.
I want to add some girls so that the ratio becomes for every boy, I have two girls. So how can you do this?
4 times 2 is 8, plus 2 is 100. We knew that. Four quarters is $1.00.
Which is the same thing as the cube root, which is the same thing as the cube root of -1 times the cube root of 512 and this one is pretty straight forward to answer. What number, when I raise it to the third power, do I get -1?
Let's see, 210 does not go into 4. It does not going into 41. It goes into 417 one time, because two times would be 420-- one time.
What's 10 squared? That's 10 times 10, that's 100.
And actually to make it clear, because once again, as I said, this is ambiguous, it's not 100% clear how many significant figures there are. Maybe it was exactly 350 feet or maybe they just rounded it to the nearest 10 feet. So a better way to represent this, they... would be to say instead of writing it 350, a better way to write it would be 3.5 times 10 to the second feet tall.
Let's see, 80 times 3 would be 240. So it's going to be 3 less than that. So 240 minus 3 is 237.
Is 120 divisible by 9? To test that out, you just add up the digits.
So, 3 x 9 = 27, we add the 2's, so we have 29 3 x 9 = 27, we add the 2's, so we have 29 so we are left with, if we subtract, if we re-group, or borrow, however we want to call it, this could be 14, this could be a 4, (I'll use a new color) this would be a 4, and then the 4 is still smaller than this 9, so we need to re-group again so this could be 14 and this could be 1, but this is still smaller then this 9 right over here, so we re-group it again, this would be 11 and then this is a 2, 14 - 7 = 7, 14 - 9 = 5, 11 - 9 = 2, so we are left with did I do that right?
Now, if x increases by 1 again to 5, then y is going to increase 0.4 to 2.
And here it becomes very clear, 10/100 is definitely larger than 700. Another way you could think about this is, look, if you were to increment by hundredths here, you would start at 7/100, 8/100, 9/100, and then you would get to 10/100.
A, the inverse-- inv, short for inverse-- is 1 over A. So the inverse of 2/3 is 3/2, or the inverse of 5, because 5 is the same thing as 5/1, so the inverse is 1/5.
There are on the order of 100 billion new cells in the human body per day. So even if a mutation only occurs one in a million times, you're still dealing with roughly 100,000 mutations, and maybe most of the mutations, maybe they're just some little random things that don't really do a lot. But if the mutations are a little bit more severe, the cell will recognize it and destroy itself.
6.7 times 6.7. So we have 7 times 7 is 49.
So 0 shows up four times. So we'll draw a little bar graph here.
So 1/7 times 7x is equal to 35 times 1/7.
So 10/3, so we might have 0, 1, 2, 3, 4.
So I'm like, just keep walking, she's on my six. (Laughter) And then I hear, "Vulnerability TED!"
(Applause) Thank you very much. (Applause)
Hi this is Kish and yh he is going to talk you about how long he has been breaking for and and how hip hop or breakdance has changed from last year to this year go on Kish I have been breaking for two years I have only started breaking when I came to Loughborough the Breakdance Society and i got influenced into this by the different latin type of dance
You can divide the numerator and the denominator by 9. So we could divide both of them by 9.
So we have 121.907 divided by 1.07, and you get this crazy thing with all of these digits, but this is going to be our final answer, so here we do care about significant figures. So tiles fitting in the bathroom, we get something that is actually just keeps going, so it's... Let me write this in a new color.
So either way, you're going to get the same thing. And just be very clear, here we added the exponents. Because we had the same base and we're multiplying them.
Well, one thing you need to remember about multiplication is, it doesn't matter what order you do the multiplication in. So this is going to be the same thing as 3 times 3 times 3 times x times x times x. And just based on what we reviewed just here, that part right there, 3 times 3, three times, that's 3 to the third power.
(Laughter) (Applause) They're three. But as we just heard in this last session, there's such competition now to get into kindergarten -- to get to the right kindergarten -- that people are being interviewed for it at three.
20% of $150's $30, so it decreased by $30, and it definitely got us to $120.
2 times 5 is 10, plus 3 is 13.
And these are all positive so this is plus 9, this is a positive 30. 80 minus 50 is 30. I have 700 minus 300 which is 400, and I have 6000 minus 3000 which is 3000.
1 is neither prime nor composite. 1 is neither. And finally we get to 17.
So the basic rules are when you multiply two negative numbers, so let's say I had negative 2 times negative 2. First you just look at each of the numbers as if there was no negative sign.
So you should always think about it in your head, OK,, well, yeah, multiplying by 3. So that also makes sense. So if we multiply by 3 right over here the 9 times 3 is 27/2.
1 times 9 is 9.
All I did is I took one over two to the ten and I flipped it and I made the exponent negative. And I think you know that already from level two exponents. And now, once again, we can just add the exponents.
That's 15 + 50, which is 65. So this would have been a faster way to do it, especially if you recognize that it's pretty easy to go from 20 to 100.
So it's going to go into it eight times, eight times is going to be less than 138, so we stick the eight here. And notice to do this little trial and error here I had to make sure I got the right exact answer with that eight right over here.
But you have not known total chaos -- just wait...
"Meraki," with passion, with love
Let's see, 8 times 12 is 96, so that's too big, so 12 goes seven times. So this is equal to 7. And if we take-- well, let me write it out.
"The craziest thing was, I'd never seen any of that before, except bread. (Laughter) I didn't know what was meat, what was vegetarian.
So that's the same thing as two to the eighth. Interesting.
Because my students, what they said when they looked upon the world, and I asked them, "What do you really think about the world?" Well, I first discovered that the textbook was Tintin, mainly.
Even the dodos are laughing now.
What I've marked here, 100, 200, 300, 400, these are all multiples of 100.
We can start at point E , go in the direction of C and go beyond C, so it is a ray, ray EC you could start in E and go in the direction of A and go beyond A, so EA is a ray, and we can start at E and go in the direction of F and go beyond F, that is ray EF ray EF and ray CF are different as the starting points are different
Just put the three up there, then you got four times two. Four times two. And they're going to have to add the three.
-7(x + y) and just to verify, if you wanted to go the other way, multiply this -7 times (x + y) and you'll get this
My big idea is a very, very small idea that can unlock billions of big ideas that are at the moment dormant inside us.
3 times 5 is 15.
Anyway, that's what the 4 in the hundred's place represents
You're just dividing it into groups of three. And how many groups do we have? We have one group.
If I multiply 10 by itself, that is 100. So this is equal to-- and let me write it this way. Normally, you could skip this step.
The 4 in 110,413 is 1/10 the value of the 4 in 54,350. And it makes complete sense. This 4 is one place to the right of this 4.
3 is, obviously, equal to 3.
It is 10/18, but when you look at these two numbers, you immediately or you might immediately see that they share some common factors. They're both divisible by 2, so if we want it in lowest terms, we want to divide them both by 2. So divide 10 by 2, divide 18 by 2, and you get 10 divided by 2 is 5, 18 divided by 2 is 9.
We have a point, we could pick one of these points, I'll just go with the negative 3, 6. And we have our slope.
And then there's 0 ones, so we could just write that out as 0 if we like. Now, what we have on the right here is almost what they have on the right over here.
So we're going from 3, which is the same thing as 6/2 to 9/2. So once again, we are increasing by 3/2. So in order for this to be a linear equation or a linear relationship, every time we increase by 1 in the x direction, we need to increase by 3/2.
5 and 1/4 can be rewritten as the same thing as 5 plus 1/4, which is the same thing as-- we just saw that five whole pies is the same thing as 20/4. And to see that these are the same thing, you literally just divide 4 into 20. You get 5, and nothing is left over.
3 to the negative 1 is equal to 1 over 3 to the 1 power, which is the same thing is 1/3. So if we replace 1/3 with 3 to the negative 1, this is 3 to the negative 1 to the negative 2 power. These two things are equivalent statements.
There's no other common factors between 100 and 3. So let's write all of them with 300 as the common denominator. So let me do this in this reddish color.
So we can factor 117 as 3 times 39. Now 39, we can factor as-- that jumps out more at us that that's divisible by 3.
3 to the second power is 9.
Bring down the 2 3 goes into 12 four times
What would happen if you were to multiply 5 times negative 3 You're not quite sure about this just yet You're also not quite sure what would happen if you multiply two negative numbers.
Let's just finish factoring it since we started it. It's also divisible by 4, and 4 × 6 = 24. So these are all of the factors of 24, clearly more than just 1 and 24.
If you multiply the 2(5), you get 10. So, this simplifies to 6x + 10. Now, let's try something that's a little bit more evolved.
So let's just go through all of these, actually, just to see all of the examples. So first we're going to have 3/7 plus 2/7. Our denominators are the same, so we can just add the numerators.
So in order this whole thing, all of this has to be divisible by nine.
1 gram is equal to 1,000 milligrams, so we could say times 1,000 milligram per gram. The grams cancel out, and we're left with 42,200 milligrams, right?
What's in the box? Whatever it is must be pretty important, because I've traveled with it, moved it, from apartment to apartment to apartment.
Here are the pedometer readings for the past four days: on Saturday, she went 3.89 miles; Sunday, 5.1;
When 56 is divided by 10 to the third, the decimal point moves blank places to the blank.
So that tells us that if we start with x, and if we were to take 25% of x, you could imagine, that's the same thing as multiplying it by 25%, which is the same thing as multiplying it, if you view it as a decimal, times 0.25 times x.
So 8/2 is the same thing 4. Let me rewrite this, just as a bit of review.
Actually, let me use a skinnier pen because that does look bad.
[This video contains no audio narrations.]
So we have here it says: 2 times 4/3 = 8 times blank. I encourage you to pause the video right now and try to think about what should go in this blank.
It would've been easier-- let me just rewrite it. That's the easiest thing. I'm having technical difficulties.
Here is GDP per capita from 1900 to 1929. Now let's imagine that you were an economist in 1929, trying to forecast future growth for the United States, not knowing that the economy was about to go off a cliff, not knowing that we were about to enter the greatest economic disaster certainly in the 20th century. What would you have predicted, not knowing this?
Let me do this in a color you can see. You have 8 hundreds.
5 times 8 we know is 40. So it's 40 times 10 to the minus 3 times 10 to the minus 4. And if you know your exponent rules, you know that when you multiply two numbers that have the same base, you can just add their exponents.
He thinks he's got a way of getting rid of the C. He says, what I'm going to do is I'm going to just subtract a C from the left-hand side.
That's the commutative law of addition, which is just a very fancy way of saying that, well, 8 plus 4 is the same thing as 4 plus 8. It doesn't matter which number comes before the addition sign and which one comes after. So 8 plus 4 is the same thing as 4 plus 8.
15/50 is the same thing as 30/100. So the total number of penguins is 50.
Or another way to write that and I'll just write all the different ways just so you get familiar with-- dr/dt is equal to dx/dt. This is just a standard derivative. x of t is a scalar function. So this is a standard derivative times i plus dy/dt times j.
In this video, I want to do a couple more word problems dealing with graphs of lines. So here we have a gym is offering a deal to new members. Customers can sign up by paying a registration fee of $200 and then a monthly fee of $39.
So one block in Model A that is with pink would be the same thing as four blocks in Model B.
And let's say we know the measure of angle DBA, let's say we know that that's equal to 40 degrees.
Notice, here it included 5/3. We put a bracket. Here, we're not including 10/3.
Mount Elbert in Colorado is the highest peak in the Rocky Mountains.
And two to the first times two to the eighth, by the same rule we just did, is equal to two to the ninth. So I thought I would just throw that out to you. And it works even with negative exponents.
And this notion which I just did here, this is actually called simple interest. Which is essentially you take the original amount you borrowed, the interest rate, the amount, the fee that you pay every year is the interest rate times that original amount, and you just incrementally pay that every year. But if you think about it, you're actually paying a smaller and smaller percentage of what you owe going into that year.
Negative two times three. Well, one way to think about it-- Now we are talking about intuition in this video and in the future videos.
10 to the third is 10 times 10 times 10 which is equal to 1,000. I think you see a general pattern here.
Well, we could divide 48 by 4, and we will get to 12, and whatever we did to the numerator, we have to do to the denominator, so if we divide 4 by 4, we get 1. So then we're left with 12 times 5, which is equal to 60.
So let's let x equal days after Monday.
That 64 is not greater than 64. I have to drink 64.01 ounces or 0.00001 ounces.
You might have heard the word metastasis, and that's just the notion of these run amok cells all of a sudden being able to travel to different parts of the body. And I think you guys know what we call these cells. These cells that aren't respecting their cellular neighborhood.
None. How many times does it go into one thousand?
And then if we wanted to write this as a decimal, 4/5 is 0.8. And if you want to verify that, you could verify that 5 goes into 4-- and there's going to be a decimal. So let's throw some decimals in there.
You have 2/6-- You could say that 2/6 has either been used up, or 2/6 is left. And 2/6 is the exact same thing 1/3, divide the numerator and the denominator by 2.
And then all of this is multiplied by the amount of time that passes by. Once again, this is our total displacement. So this part right over here-- let me do it in magenta-- we have to vi's.
what i want to do in this video is a handful of fairly simple inequality videos. But the real value of it, I think, will be just to get you warmed up in the notation of inequality. So, let's just start with one. we have x minus 5 is less than 35.
(Let me rewrite it here, just so it's neat.) 30 goes into 1500 - All we did is we moved both decimals over to the right, twice. Or you could say, we just multiplied the numerator and the denominator here by 100 - which wouldn't change the value of the fraction.
1 plus 3 plus 5 plus 20 equals, let's see, 1 plus 3 is 4. 4 plus 5 is 9. 9 plus 20 is 29.
So let's divide by a again, so one over a. So we're going to take a to the zero and divide it by a. a to the zero is one, so what's one divided by a? It's one over a.
This is also interpreted as 2 times x Once again, so in this situation
4 times 3 is 12.
So we get negative 12 plus 2 on the left-hand side, negative 12 plus 2 is negative 10. So the left-hand side is a negative 10. Let's see what the right-hand side is.
B I'll do in a different color, for the principal root, when we say positive square root.
So this right over here is the number 3/4.
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine. Let me put some commas here to make it readable. And then we're dividing that by 3 followed by four zeros.
And I would like you to join with all of humanity to draw a line in the sand and say, "No more. No more are we going to accept this."
The following table describes the relationship between the number of servings of spaghetti Bolognese - (I don't know if I'm pronouncing that right.) Bolognese - and the number of tomatoes needed to prepare them. Test the ratios for equivalence and determine whether the relationship is proportional.
You can't have something larger than 120 dividing evenly into 120.
In particular 4,500 is an integer, but 2.7 is not an integer.
Same exact process. We're going to still be talking in terms of fifths. That's going to be the denominator.
And there's nothing else there, this is going to be 0.
A is equal to the square root of 25. Well that's the same thing as the square root of 5 times 5, which is a clearly going to be 5. We're focusing on the positive square root here.
Or if you want to do it a little bit more formally you subtract 160 m from both sides of this equation and you are left with the width (w) is equal to 200 m.
If I go back negative 1, so if I go in the x direction negative 1, that means in the y direction I go positive two, because two divided by negative one is still negative two, so I go over here. If I go back 2, I'm going to go up 4. Let me just do that.
And I'll do it down here just so I have some more real estate to work with. I'm going to divide 8 into 7. And I'm going to add a decimal point here, just because we know that this value is going to be less than 1.
I hope I achieved my goal of confusing you just now. Let's do another one. If I said seven squared times seven to the fourth.
So JL is the entire length of the segment. So this entire thing is equal to 114. Then they tell us that KL is equal to 9x plus 9
And 16 of something plus 1 of something plus 8 of something is going to be 25 of that something. And in this case, the something that we're talking about are 22nds.
It's going to get to 0.8. When x increases again by 1, then y is going to increase by 0.4 again. It's going to get to 1.2.
That's the same thing as 1 plus 2. So it's 1/3. And so this will be 16 divided by negative 1.
Well, 6 × 7 is 42.
Seven times one is seven. Seven times two is fourteen. Seven times three, twenty-one.
9 divided by 9 is 1, 9 divided by 9 is 1, so we get this as being equal to 6/9. Now, let's see.
Another aha! moment came from a 2010 Wayne State University research project that looked into pre-1950s baseball cards of Major League players. The researchers found that the span of a player's smile could actually predict the span of his life. Players who didn't smile in their pictures
Since there's 5 times the absolute value of negative 2 minus 3, the absolute value of negative 2 is positive 2. So this is 5 times 2 minus 3, which is 10 minus 3, which is again equal to 7. And notice, in this situation, the thing in the absolute value sign became a negative 2, because we said, oh, x plus 3 could be equal to negative 2.
For several thousand years, global average temperatures stayed 15 degrees Fahrenheit, that's about 8 degrees celcius below what they're today, and mile thick glaciers covered much of North America, Europe, and Asia; outside the ice-covered regions, it was so dry that survival became difficult in most areas.
So this is equal to negative 28. And we are done!
We've already seen that the fraction 2/5, or fractions
You get a 10. Let's bring down another 0.
Well, we know that 6 plus 8 is equal to 14. And so when we write it down here in the sum.... We could say... well look, the 4 is in the "ones" place.
5/8 times s is equal to 5/6. And you might be able to go straight from that. If I have 1 of something minus 3/8 of that something, I have 8/8 of that something minus 3/8 of that something, I'm going to have 5/8 of that something.
And you see, this is 2 and 1/2 less than 150, and this is 2 and 1/2 more than 150.
And then what is 27 to the 1/3 power? Well, what number times itself 3 times is equal to 27? Well, that's equal to 3.
Carry or regroup the 1.
I've noticed something interesting about society and culture. Everything risky requires a license. So, learning to drive, owning a gun, getting married.
2 plus 1 is 3. So it's 22 plus 3/9, but this can be simplified. Both the numerator and the denominator are divisible by 3.
Migrant Worker Exploitation My name is Cuseti. I used to be a migrant worker.
Well, they're giving us the Fahrenheit temperature here, so F is equal to 56, and they're asking us for the Celsius temperature, so we need to figure out what the Celsius temperature is. Well, in this one over here, if you know the Fahrenheit temperature you can solve for the Celsius termperature. So let's use this, right over here.
James and Karlee caught a lizard in their backyard. Its body is 17/8 inches long, and its tail is 10/8 inches long.
And then we can distribute this 3.
So the least common multiple of 28 and 9 have to contain a 2, a 2, a 7, a 3 and a 3. Or essentially, it's going to be 28 times 9. So let's over here multiply 28 times 9.
You could actually figure out every angle formed between the transversals and the parallel lines. If this is 120 degrees, then the angle opposite to it is also 120 degrees. If this angle is 60 degrees, then this one right here is also 60 degrees.
But let's just think in terms of 72 - 8. Well 12 - 8 is 4. So 72 - 8 is going to be 64.
150 is 25% of what number? That number right here we're seeing is x.
Let's do part a. 5 over 12 times 9 over 10. And the fun thing about multiplying and dividing fractions, at least in my mind, it's easier than adding or subtracting, you literally just multiply the numerators when you're multiplying and multiply the denominators.
What happens if I have 2 to the tenth to the fifth power? Well, let's think about what that means.
Well I get -1! This right here is -1
So price minus 20% of the price-- this is decreasing by 20% --is equal to the price this year, which they're telling us is $120. Well what's p minus 0.2 or minus 20% of p?
Twenty teachers were asked about their favorite course.
Let's do some compound inequality problems, and these are just inequality problems that have more than one set of constraints. You're going to see what I'm talking about in a second. So the first problem I have is negative 5 is less than or equal to x minus 4, which is also less than or equal to 13.
The square root of 5 times 5, that's the square root of 25, that's just going to be 5. So you can rearrange these.
To go from 3.457 to this very, very small number I mean we have had to move the decimal from 3.457 to get to this You have to move the decimal to the left a bunch
So we could just find a least common multiple in the traditional way without simplifying first. So what's the prime factorization of 28? It's 2 times 14.
Now, the square root of 2 times 2, that's clearly just going to be 2. It's going to be the square root of this times square root of that.
Negative 8/7, or if you want to write it as a mixed number, x is equal to 7 goes into 8 one time and has a remainder of 1, so it's negative 1 and 1/7. Either one would be acceptable.
8 times 8 is 64, so that's too big.
16 gallons and to figure out the dollar cost, we're gonna multiply it by dollars per gallon or gallons per dollar. Well, if we're thinking just about unit conversion, we want to multiply times the dollars per gallon. So, I can write it like this.
Identify all sets of parallel and perpendicular lines in the image below. So let's start with the parallel lines and, just as a reminder, two lines are parallel if they're in the same plane, and all of these lines are clearly in the same plane. They are in the plane of the screen your viewing right now.
Roughly 1.7 times million is roughly 1.7 million. This is a little bit more than 1.7 million, so it makes sense. Let's do another one.
That's 250 and then we add 1, we're going to have 251 toothpicks will be needed to form the 50th figure in this sequence.
1 times 7 is 7. You subtract.
So I've introduced you to a bunch of words here and now I think we have all of the tools we need to start doing some interesting proofs, and just to review here we talked about adjacent angles, and I guess any angles that add up to 90 degrees are considered to be complementary, this is adding up to 90 degrees. If they happen to be adjacent then the two outside sides will form a right angle, when you have a right angle the two sides of a right angle are considered to be perpendicular. And then if you have two angles that add up 180 degrees, they are considered supplementary, and then if they happen to be adjacent, they will form a straight angle.
This already feels like it's not going to satisfy it because it has the exact same number of large tiles, but it has one more small tile. So it's going to get something larger than 40. And you can check it out right over here.
3 to the first power is just 3. So what is this going to be equal to? This is going to be equal to-- we have the same base, x.
Which tells us that eighty-five years ago, Tarush was ten times as old as Arman.
You shared 93% of your DNA with Rhesus monkey, and 98.5% with our friend, chimpanzee.
So what values of h are going to have less than a distance from 7 and 1/2?
So we talked about inhaling and exhaling. And I mentioned that the key first step for both of them is kind of the change in volume: going up in volume and going down in volume. But I didn't really talk about how that happens exactly.
And this is porous to gases like oxygen, and nitrogen, carbon dioxide. And what we have here-- let's say that this is-- so the heart is over here.
Let's see, 186 minus just 90 would be 96, but we're subtracting 91, so it's going to be 95.
Joe Kraus says, "Persistence is the number one reason for our success." You've got to persist through failure.
4 times 201, that's the same thing as 4 times 200, which is 800, plus 4 times 0 tens, which is 0 tens, plus 4 times 1, whis is 4. So 800 plus 0 plus 4 is 804.
Make this an 8 16 minus 7 is 9
Well, what happens if we were to factor a 4 out of 8f plus 4g, which we already know is equivalent to our original expression?
And then finally, they say 125 more texts than his mother, so j is equal to mother plus 125. Now, I want this equation all in terms of j's, because we want to say how many texts could J.T. have sent. So I want all of these expressed in j, so let's just solve each of these for o in terms of j, solve for y in terms of j, solve for m in terms of j, and then we can substitute back over here.
594 minus 14 would be 580, and then 580 minus 1 more would be 579. So that right there is 579, and then we have this negative sign sitting out there. So the 100th term in our sequence will be negative 579.
This is gastric lipase, gastric means it comes from the stomach and just like the salivary lipase, the gastric lipase continues the work of digesting the fats that have entered the stomach. Now the stomach is really muscular, so it kinds of churns all this food around. The food that's come down the esophagus as a bolus and what ends up leaving the stomach is more of a liquid.
And I'm going to use it to give you my take on the stuff of life.
This right hand side, when x= (-72) does indeed equals -16.
And then the 1 and 3/4, same process.
And 22 minus 14 is 8, or the difference between 22 and 14 is 8, so the difference between 22 and 13 and 1/2 is going to be 1/2 more than that. So this is going to be 8.5. So it's going to be negative 8.5.
Let's see, it goes in - 5 × 20 = 100. So, 6 × 20 = 120.
So if you take 16 times 6, 6 times 6 is 36. Carry the 3.
It is like beggars begging from each other, thinking as if the other is the emperor. Both are thinking in the same way: the other is the emperor. Both are beggars.
Well the smallest number that's a multiple of both two and three is six. So let's convert both of these fractions to something over six. So one half is equal to what over six.
Again cosine is adjacent over hypotenuse I'm gonna skipping steps. In the last two videos I go into this in a much more detail
That is minus 2, or negative 2, I should say. 6 plus 2 is 8. Now let's keep looking at the parentheses to see where we can simplify things.
So let's say, 10.4.
And where did I get seventeen from? I just added two plus five plus ten. For every seventeen animals, I'm going to have-- Let me pick a new color.
3 to the second power is equal to 9.
And on the right-hand side. Well, this x plus two and this x plus two will cancel out. And we're left with eightx plus forty.
"You've just won the Best Blog In the World award." I was like, that sounds totally fake.
In this video, I'm going to do some more examples of simplifying radical expressions. But these are going to involve adding and subtracting different radical expressions.
Is going to be equal to 1 - because now x is 1. It'll be 1 + 5. So x + 5 will be equal to 6.
But it's 0.8 of the 2 liters is sugar, which is 40%.
Times x plus five over one. On the left-hand side, they get canceled out. So we're left with three is equal to eight times x plus five.
So let me draw a number line here. So let me draw it pretty big so we get a sense of things. So it will go all the way to there.
Here is an interesting case: 1. 1 is only divisible by 1.
And I'm so worn out at this point in my life, I look at her and I actually say,
(Laughter) And the guy behind the counter said, "I know, lady. They all came in that way."
Going from 6:15, if you go 15 minutes back, you get to 6 o'clock. We have to go 39, so we have 24 left. So then we have to go 24 minutes before 6 o'clock.
If we take 5.18 and divide it by 100, we're going to take the decimal two to the left. So one, two, we're going to have to add a zero here. So it's going to be 0.0518.
8 times 9 is 72.
This is our starting position. So we took 0 minus negative 6. So then on the y, we have to do 1 minus negative 2.
We could say 422-- I'm just going to say dg. That's not really a familiar unit-- decigrams. And how many decigrams are there per gram?
10 square roots of 2. And once again, this is irrational. You can't express it as a fraction with an integer and a numerator and the denominator.
This isn't divisible by 2, and it also doesn't look divisible by 3. So this looks like we are done with the problem. And you can verify.
21 goes into 160, well, 20 would go into 160 8 times, So let's try 7, lets see if 7 is the right thing. 7 times 1 is 7, 7 times 2 is 14 and then when we subtract, we should get a remainder less than 21.
And let's start dividing, 21 goes into 1 zero times, 21 goes into 16 zero times.
(Noise) But they react to foreground sounds. You'll hear that in a second.
(Applause) Thank you very much.
Let's remember, we're talking around 200 B.C. here. - which is actually getting close to the end of the life of hieroglyphics, as well.
2 times 3, this and ' equal to 6 and then 4 times 3 and ' equal to 12 6 more ' equal to 12 and 18 soon this works
And so now our question is, how much time is there between 3:35 and 4:00 PM? Well, once again, 60 minutes in an hour. 4:00 PM is essentially the 60th minute.
If our change in x is 5. So notice, here our change in x is 5. Our change in x is 5.
That's equal to 1 times 1/10 which is equal to 1/10 1 times---which is equal to 0--I skip the step right there Let me add 1 times 10 to the 0 So we have something natural
Deflection is zero.
Most cells in the human body just go about their business on a daily basis in a fairly respectable way. Let's say that I have some cell here. This could be maybe a skin cell or really any cell in any tissue in the body.
10 times 10 is 100.
So if I do 2 + 7 + 9 actually let me just write it out. +9 + 5 +8 +8. What's this going to be?
7 × 27 - we already figured out - was 189. We subtracted. We had a remainder of 1.
So how did things get so different for us? In the late '40s, my dad -- a Pullman porter, son of a slave -- bought a house in the Hunts Point section of the South Bronx, and a few years later, he married my mom. At the time, the community was a mostly white, working-class neighborhood.
0 times 25 is 0. Subtract. No remainder.
Well, in that case we know that 0.09x-- 0.09, that's the same thing as nine percent of x-- is equal to three.
We could start with a 1, and then multiply it by negative 1 two times-- multiply it by negative 1 twice. And what's this going to be equal to? And once again, by our old definition, you could also just say, hey, ignoring this one, because that's not going to change the value, we took two negative 1's and we're multiplying them.
That is what Kanak Das has done. And in South Africa, we had taken our innovators, and many of us had gone there share with the colleagues in South Africa as to how innovation can become a means of liberation from the drudgery that people have. And this is a donkey cart which they modified.
We have 5 bottles, and each of them are 2 liters each. So we have 5 × 2. And what is that equal to?
It is 5 or greater, so rounding up means that we go to 24,000, and since we're rounding up, we make the 2 into a 3. We increment it by one, so rounding up, so 24,300. That's what we mean by rounding up.
25 is 5 times 5.
Think about the absolute value of this.
Nevis is 67 times 20. So times 67 times 20. Well I can divide 67 by 67, and I get Yukon is 298 times 20 meters.
I want you to bring her home because we don't have safe homes." The story of this little girl: She had been raped by her paternal grandfather every day for six months.
Notice the 0. They didn't write that. So we can ignore that.
And 8 goes into 40 how many times? Well, 8 times 5 is 40, so it goes in nice and evenly.
And in the next video, I will show what the effect is. Well, one, I'll explain how we think about a magnetic field.
So that's 536 over 6.
This is the inside of of an alveolus. This is its membrane right here, super thin, almost one cell thick. And then you have a capillary running right next to it.
So 30% of x is equal to 15. Or another way of saying this is we could say - instead of writing 30%, we could write that as a decimal - as 0.30 of x.
She'd lie beside me and say, "Auntie, I wish to be well. I wish to go to school."
First, consider the expression for take the quantity of negative 4 times x and add 9.
(Laughter) (Applause) And I was thrilled. We all know it was an amazing movie, and it was so interesting to see it go out into the culture and become this phenomenon and to see all the different permutations of it.
So essentially, we're going to take 549 minutes and divide them into groups of 60. Why 60? Because we know that one hour is equal to 60 minutes.
3 is a factor (overlapping) [Sal] 3 is a factor, we don't have to write [Ben] so you just put it once. [Sal]
In this video, I really wanted to introduce you to some terminology for some basic angle types and terminology. I wanted to introduce you to are acute angles, right angles, and obtuse angles. I think when we go through these, it will be pretty self-explanatory.
Let's take 549 and divide it by 60.
So that's what we get on the left-hand side of the equation when we substitute x is equal to negative 1. We get that it equals 6. So let's see what happens when we substitute negative 1 to the right-hand side of the equation.
That is 10/3 right there, and everything less than that, but not including 10/3, is in our solution set.
Remember, 7x is equal to 21. It's the same thing as 21. In order for this to be equal to that when I divide by 7 on the left, I also have to divide by 7 on the right.
26 minus 7 is 19.
This is a number. And we can actually plot it on the number line. Now you might say, OK, well, that's fair about 1/5.
But with magnetism you always have a dipole. If I were to take this magnet, this one right here, and if I were to cut it in half, somehow miraculously each of those halves of that magnet will turn into two more magnets. Where this will be the south, this'll be the north, this'll be the south, this will be the north.
That's also consistent with the intuition of adding negative three repeatedly five times, now look above above us slightly higher so you can see ideas of multiplying two negatives, but we can do the exact same product experiment. We want whatever this answer to be consistent with the rest of mathematics that we know so we can do the same product experiment.
Let's see, so if I say ninety-one times thirty-six hundred, Woops! I messed up. (carefully) Ninety-one times thirty-six hundred. that equals a huge number divided by five thousand, two hundred and eighty.
Because we can have 2 significant digits. This was 3, this is 2. We only limited it to 2, because that was the smallest number of significant digits we had in all of the things that we were taking the product of.
Express twenty five degrees Celsius as a temperature in degrees Fahrenheit using the formula Fahrenheit or F is equal to nine fifths times the Celsius degrees plus thirty two, so they're telling us that we have twenty five degrees Celsius. So, we can put that in for "C" here and we'll get the temperature in Fahrenheit degrees.
So how many groups of three am I going to have? Well, let me draw some groups of three. So that is one group of three.
Five minus four is one, so the remainder is one, and that's what we use here. And of course, we keep the denominator the same. So five halves equals two and one half.
The angles in a circle-- or there are 360 degrees in a circle. I don't know if you remember.
You know, it has 1, 64, and 8, but it also has 2 times 32. It has -- you know, 4 times 16, and you could go on. 64 has a ton of factors.
largest number, or the largest common factor, of both 92 and 28, and divide both of these numbers by that common factor. So let's figure out what it is. And to do that, let's just take the prime factorization of 92, and then we'll do the prime factorization of 28.
7 plus 9. That's going to be in the orange parentheses. And then you have the 7 times 2 plus that, on the left hand side.
In a previous video, we saw that we could view 2/3 times 6 as whatever number is 2/3 of the way to 6 on the number line, which we saw is 4.
This led to a little breakdown -- (Laughter) -- which actually looked more like this.
We've been hard at work to update Gmail with a new look and I'm excited to share with you some of the biggest improvements.
If Sandy starts off with a $20 bill, takes the cab for 5 miles and leaves a $1 tip. How much money will she be left with? Well, let's first just think about how long, much this five mile cab ride is gonna cost her.
So 79%, that literally means 79 per 100. If you wanted to write it as a fraction, it would be 79/100. But if you wanted to write it as a decimal, it's 0.79, which could be 0-- or we would write it down a 0.79.
And let's say that this is 0, this is 1, and this is 2. And of course, we could keep going if we had more space to 3, 4, and on and on and on. And what I want to do, instead of taking a circle and dividing it into 5 equal sections,
And just remember when a negative number is big, so like -50, that's actually colder than -20, right? So a -50 is actually even a smaller number than -20 because it's even further to the left of -20 That's just something you'll get an intuitive feel for.
Or another way of saying it is S is equal to 6 feet. How tall is the giraffe?
3 into 4, 3 goes into 4 one time 1*3 is 3
So z squared, that's the same thing as-- I'll do it in a different color --4 squared over x, 1, plus y, negative 2, plus x squared, that's 1 squared, over x, which is 1, minus y. y is negative 2.
93 goes into-- I make a really long line up here because I don't know how many decimal places we'll do. And remember, it's always the denominator being divided into the numerator.
Let's do two times eleven.
Let me write this down just so-- Notice when your first term, you have 15, and you don't subtract negative 6 at all. Or you could say you subtract negative 6 0 times.
12s divided by 12 is s. The number of sessions. But if I have an equal sign, I can't just willy-nilly divide one side by 12 without doing the exact same thing to the other side.
(Laughter) I would soon find out that there was a high price to pay for my freedom, and for questioning the patriarchy. But I was happy to pay it, because for every blow that I received,
And that's where-- I guess, you could kind of say-- that is where a compass, the north point of a compass, will point to. And actually, magnetic north moves around because we have all of this moving fluid inside of the earth. And a bunch of other interactions.
Then after 2 days, she has $35. 2 in the x direction, then we go up 35. So that's that point right over there.
Which is the same thing as 8 times 8 times 8 Well clearly this is 8 So the answer
1/2 of 3/4 gets us, once again, right over here to this point-- 3/8. So either way you imagine it, whether you're essentially taking 3/4 of 1/2, or saying I'm going to go 3/4 of the way to 1/2, or you say I'm going to go 1/2 of the way to 3/4, either way, hopefully it now makes conceptual sense. You can visualize it, and it makes numeric sense that this is going to be equal to 3/8.
UV: they both intersect line CD at the exact same angle, at this angle right here. And, in particular, it is at a right angle. And if you have two lines that intersect a third line at the same angle, at the same angle. so that these are actually corresponding angles.
2 × 3 × 5 is the prime factorization of 30.
Don't say, OK, 10 plus 2 is 12, so negative 10 plus 2 is negative 12. No!
The pancreas, and the pancreas is really important. It secretes probably the most important digestive enzymes into the small intestine and those enzymes are amylase, and this is now pancreatic amylase. It also secretes pancreatic lipase, another way of digesting fat.
I'm going to do it in orange... so z is greater than equal to negative 6 and this means you include negative 6 and its everything greater than that greater than that including 4. It's everything greater than that. So we see we've essentially shaded in the entire number line!
14 times 2 is 28. Add another 14. Let's see, you add 10.
You give me eleven students of this -- you could split this classroom into a bunch of groups.
I had to meet my love.
It looks like 6 would work 6 times 21 is 126, so that looks like it works.
Absolute value of negative 8 is 8 and absolute value of 8 is 8. So clearly 8 is equal to 8. Let's do a couple more examples.
And then we have no remainder. So it's eighteen, and there's nothing behind the decimal point. So it;s eighteen, in our case, $eighteen.
2/3, if we write 12 in the denominator, 3 times 4 is 12, so 2 times 4 is 8. These are equivalent. We multiplied the numerator and the denominator by 4.
Directed by Vitaliy Versace Singer..Don't speak to me, Is so hard to resist when you talk to me Don't reach for me I know that you care, but when it comes up to loving, you are unaware Don't you know you are a perfect drug
And this is why you can do the same reasoning for divisibility by 9 Because they are divisible by 9 as well
Nobody has ever come out of the chaos. ...
And then all of that over 6, and then that's the same thing. That's the same thing as 6/6 plus 6/6 plus 6/6. And I could make this right over here in orange.
And that makes sense. 25% of 600 is 150. 1/4th of 600 is 150.
So what does this tell us? This means that the distance, another way to interpret this-- remember, absolute value is the same thing as distance from 0-- so another way to interpret this statement is that the distance from h to 0 has to be less than 7 and 1/2.
Minus 25. Now we can evaluate this pretty easily. Negative 7 plus 10.
Ron and Hermione are practising lifting feathers into the air with magic. Hermione can lift a feather 35 feet into the air which is 5 times as high Ron can lift a feather. How high can Ron lift a feather with his magic?
1/2 time 2 is 1 and then b times b is b squared. Fair enough. And they tell us that the area is 168.
1,050, not 150. The left-hand side, you're just going to be left with 210t. While the right-hand side, let's see, you're going to be 0 plus 0 is 0.
Let's say we had "7x minus 4" And we want to evaluate that when when x is equal to three. Where we see the x, we want to put the 3 there
150 is 25% of the base, of 600. The important thing is how you solve this problem. The words themselves, you know, those are all really just definitions.
So let's once again multiply, or I guess in this case we're dividing by 1.61 and we get, so we get. Let's just divide our previous value by 1.61, 1.61, and we get 23, I'll just round up, 23.3. This is equal to 23.3, 23.
Incubate Pictures presents In association with Post Carbon Institute
We are left with 7/10. So of the students who own a cell phone, 7 out of 10 of the students who own a cell phone, own a cell phone that is more than one year old. And we are done.
Twelve times negative four.
Well, by this definition, you start with a 1, and then you multiply it by negative 1 three times, so negative 1 times negative 1 times negative 1. Or you could just think of it as you're taking three negative 1's and you're multiplying it, because this 1 doesn't change the value. And this is going to be equal to negative 1 times negative 1 is positive 1, times negative 1 is negative 1.
The sternum is this middle bone and all the ribs on both sides attached there.
So now you, the ancient philosopher, feel pretty good. Not only this all consistent with all the mathematics you know the distributive property is also the property of multiplying something times something all these things you already know, and now this actually makes conceptual sense to you, this is actually very consistent with with your notations, your original notations, or one of the positive notations of multiplication which is as repeated addition
simply 3x squared minus 8x plus 7 plus 2x to the third minus x squared plus eight x minus 3 so when we simplify this we're essentially going to add up like terms and just as a reminder we can only add or subtract like terms or simplify like terms and just a reminder and what I mean by that if I had an x squared to an x squared these are like terms they're both x terms raised to the same power the same degree so if I have one x squared and another x squared well then I have 2x squared - this is 2x squared If I have an x to the third - let's say I have 3x to thirds plus another 4x to the thirds Well that means I have 7x to the thirds - 7x to the thirds
It'll also go into 45. So this is the same thing. 30 is 2 times 15 and 45 is 3 times 15.
And then let's see, we have 2x is greater than negative 4.
So these fractions are the same thing.
That's the same thing as 2 times, x times x, which is the same thing as 2x squared. And that's choice B. Anyway, see you in the next video.
Let's get started with some problems. Let's see.
Is ( -1, 7) is solution for the equations below. The first equation is x + 2y =13, second equation is 3x - y = -11, Inorder for -1,7 for solution for the system it needs to satisfy both equations. x = -1 and y = 7, need to satisfy both equations to be a solution. Lets try with the first equation.
You multiply 8,895 times 1/8,895, you are going to get 1.
3 to the first power-- let me write the powers-- 3 to the first, second, third. We'll just do it the with the number 3. So 3 to the first power is 3.
Put two 0's here. 2 times 3 is 6. 2 times 4 is 8.
12 is divisible by 3, so 3 will go into it. So 75 is 3 times something else. And if you've ever dealt with change, you know that if you have three quarters, you have 75 cents, or if you have 3 times 25, you have 75.
So the length of my arrow represents its speed to some degree.
You can view that as completion...completion and then Wa...Al-Muqabala that means essentially 'balancing' completion and balancing. So if we wanted to translate it and I know this is not a video on translating Arabic. but the book... the book I guess this is saying 'compendious on calculation by completion and balancing' is the rough translation over there.
(Applause) In most music, we think of the "one" as the downbeat, the beginning of the musical phrase: one, two, three, four. But in West African music, the "one" is thought of as the end of the phrase,
8 times 5 is 40, plus 3 is 43. Now we're multiplying this 10 times 54. Gets us to 540.
Now, to visualize it over here, you know, how did he get 1 2/3, let's think about it. Instead of doing 1, I'm going to do circles. I am going to do circles.
4 times 3 is 12.
6 of something minus 24 of something will get us negative 18 of that something. Let's do another one. Let's say I have the square root of 180 plus 6 times the square root of 405.
And then the next year, let's call that year two, it shrinks by twenty-five percent. So this could have happened in the stock market. The first year I have a good year, my portfolio grows by twenty-five percent.
20 is the same thing as 120 over 6, right? Minus w. So w is negative 135 over 6.
"Give me a place to stand, and I will move the world." I will just tell you that we are also doing a competition among children for creativity, a whole range of things. We have sold things all over the world, from Ethiopia to Turkey to U.S. to wherever.
42.2 times 1,000. Hopefully, that doesn't confuse you too much. The important thing is to always take a step back and really visualize and think about, should I be getting a
Negative 28 plus 8 is negative 20, so this candidate is starting to look pretty good. It's pretty good. It satisfies these two points, and frankly, for any of these linear functions, if it satisfies any of these two points, if some linear function generated all of these, if some function can generate any two of them, it will satisfy all of these, because two points define a line.
Now, let's do 7 and 1/5.
Well, 8 minus 7 is equal to 1. Is this right over here equal to 2 times this 7 minus 7? Well, yeah, it's equal to 7.
So that $59 was kind of the increment of how much more compound interest cost me. I'm about to run out of time, so I'll do a couple more examples in the next video, just you really get a deep understanding of how to do compound interest, how the exponents work, and what really is the difference.
I have 4 of that something. minus 48. And now I can.. lets see I want to get rid of this 48 on the left hand side, I want only x here. So let me add 48 to both sides of the equation. this in a new color!
And instead of eating one piece, this time I actually ate 2 of the 4 pieces. Or I ate 2/4 of the pie.
It means you can include negative 6... Let me do that in a more different color...
Well, the largest power of 10 that fits into 6 is just 1. So we could write it as, something times 10 to the 0. This is just 1, right?
Well, seven minus three is going to give us four. And then we're going to have six-ninths minus two-fifths.
You could do it by hand, but this is a little bit faster and less likely to make a careless mistake-- times 9.2 times 3.01, which is equal to 40.1534. So this is equal to 40.1534. And of course, this is going to be multiplied times 10 to this thing.
7 you can't break it down anymore. All you can say is 7 equals 1 times 7. And in that case you haven't really broken it down much.
So very similarly we can substract one from both sides to get rid of that one on the left-hand side.
Then minus one over thirty-six.
What is 6 to the seventh power divided by 6 to the third power? Well, once again, we can just use this property. This going to be 6 to the 7 minus 3 power, which is equal to 6 to the fourth power.
7 minus 11 is negative 4. That's our first equation. Now we have 7 times some number-- this is the new problem --7 times some number x is equal to 21.
So this is interesting, so we have a 2, and then were multiplying by 3 twice.
So you have negative 3x is greater than 27. Now, to just turn this into an x, we want to divide both sides by negative 3. But remember, when you multiply or divide both sides of an inequality by a negative number, you swap the inequality.
You could literally view this as 60 three times, so you could view this as 60 plus 60 plus 60. And you might be able compute this in your head. 60 plus 60 is 120, plus another 60 is 180.
57 minus 50 is 7. And now we're almost done. We bring down that 5 right over there.
So 21 times 21: 1 times 21 is 21, 2 times 21 is 42.
So 15 doesn't go into 8 at all.
"What is the ratio or what is the relationship between the distance around a circle and the distance across it? And is that the same for all circles? And is there a way for us to feel really good that that is definitely true?"
CA: And in the last year, tell us one hopeful thing that you've seen happening.
And four times thirteen--let's see: four times ten is forty Four times three is twelve, so it gives us fifty-two And you can work that out by hand if you like
Now let's look at 7/8 of 12. Let's see, if we divide 12 and 8 each by 4, this is going to be the same thing as 7 times 3 over 2, which is the same thing as 21 over 2, which is equal to 10.5. So if y were equal to 7/8 x, 12 daisies would cost $10.50.
So let's see if our change in y is constant. When we go from 11 to 14, we go up by 3. When we go from 14 to 19, we go up by 5, so I already see that it is not constant.
I think we're just about ready to learn how to subtract pretty much any number from any other number. So let's just review a little bit of what we know already. So if I were to ask you what 16 - 4 is,
The 8 and the -1 but once again common sense tells you that if you have eight of something and you take away one of them you have 7 of that something and then finally you have a plus 5 so we're done this simplified to 3x plus 10 y plus 7z plus 5
I just multiplied 0.05 times 1,000. And with the units, I now have kilometers times meters over kilometers. And the kilometers cancel out.
16 - 1 is 15, minus 2 is 14, minus 3 is 13, minus 4 is 12. And you would have the answer.
let me make this a little bit neater-- if this is now 5 over 5 or 5/5, we've already seen that this is a whole. And over here, if we've traveled 5/5 of the way towards 1, we've gotten to the whole 1. 5/5 is the exact same thing as 1.
So this is going to be the same thing as 9 to the 2 times 3 power, which is the same thing as 9 to the sixth power. And we'd be done. We've expressed our answer in exponential form, 9 to the sixth power, we've simplified.
That is 22. That is equal to 22. And we are done.
Let's say I were to ask you what 5 to the sixth power divided by 5 to the second power is?
(Laughter) Adults and fellow TEDsters, you need to listen and learn from kids, and trust us and expect more from us. You must lend an ear today, because we are the leaders of tomorrow, which means we're going to take care of you when you're old and senile.
7 minus 0 is 7. Now we can bring down a 0. We bring down a 0.
So instead of an m here, we could say, well $33.00 is equal to the amount of money James has plus 5. And so now we just need to think about how much money does James have. And I encourage you to pause the video and think about it on your own.
We're asked to shade 20% of the square below. Before doing that, let's just even think about what percent means. Let me just rewrite it.
55 years old, and she's solar-electrified 200 houses for me in Afghanistan. And they haven't collapsed. She actually went and spoke to an engineering department in Afghanistan and told the head of the department the difference between AC and DC.
She got the World's Children's Prize five years ago, and she went to Sweden. First time ever going out of her village. Never seen Sweden.
I've got a square here. What makes it a square is all of the sides are equal. I haven't gone in depth into angles yet, but these are at right angles to each other.
91 minus 81, well, that's just 10. And then we are done. And then let's do one more.
Because ninety nine is divisible by nine. So this works out. And same thing over here.
So what is ten times-- let's just start with zero.
3 times 25, 25 is 5 times 5. So this is a prime factorization, but they want us to write our answer using exponential notation. So that just means, if we have repeated primes, we can write those as an exponent.
It doesn't go into 15.
X is the unknown because you can't say "sh" in Spanish.
Are the triangles shown below congruent, similar or neither? So, for two triangles to be congruent, they have to have same size and shape
The easiest thing that i can think of doing is first take the prime factorization of 27000 and that will help us kind of structure our thought of what all the different divisors of 27000 would have to look like so 27000 is the same thing as 27 times 1000 which is the same thing as 3 to the 3rd times 10 to the 3rd and 10 is of course the same thing as 2 times 5 so this is the same thing as 2 times 5 to the third or the same thing as 2^3 times 5^3
So if we're talking about 5 and 1/4, and you can literally think of this as 5 and 1/4 or 5 plus 1/4, that's what 5 and 1/4 represents.
We have 4y plus 8 is greater than negative 48. So let's get rid of the 8 from the left hand side.
The value of the 4 in 110,413 is 1/10 the value of the 4 in 54,350.
[This video has no audio narration.]
So the absolute value of -1 is just positive version of -1 which is just 1. So 1 is clearly less than 2.
Now, let's think about expressions with more than one variable. So, let's say I had the expression "a + b" and I were to ask you what is this expression equal to when "a" is equal to 5 and "b" is equal to 7
As it turns out, there's a pattern. As it turns out, all the great inspiring leaders and organizations in the world, whether it's Apple or Martin Luther King or the Wright brothers, they all think, act and communicate the exact same way. And it's the complete opposite to everyone else.
And then our fourth term is negative 3. And they want us to figure out what the 100th term of this sequence is going to be.
Girls as young as 12 being prostituted for less than a dollar a night. It's disheartening, it's sad. And then someone asked me, just before my TEDTalk, a few days ago,
Don't be concerned about the address, you simply go on sending love letters.
So one way to think about it is that this could be five 1/2's added together. So you could view this as 1/2 plus 1/2 plus 1/2 plus 1/2 plus 1/2, which is the same thing as 1 plus 1 plus 1 plus 1 plus 1, over 2, which is equal to 5/2. The other way to think about this is that you start with 5 things.
This isn't going to change. This was already 5/100. If we multiply the denominator here by 10 - (That's what we did.
I can factor out a 7.
If we do eleven times three, it is equal to thirty-three. Eleven times four is equal to forty-four.
(Laughter) Thank you. I never practiced law a day in my life;
Well, that looks like 25%, that's the percent. The amount and the base in this problem. And based on how they're wording it, I assume amount means when you take the 25% of the base, so they're saying that the amount-- as my best sense of it-- is that the amount is equal to the percent times the base.
If r is the number of hot dogs that Joey can eat in a minute, and N is the total number of hot dogs he eats in the contest, we can write the following equation. So this makes sense. He eats a total of N hot dogs, and the contest is 10 minutes.
(Laughter) FN: Can you bring out our baby?
So the second equation right here is negative 6t plus g is equal to 6. Now, think about what happens if I were to add these two equations. Remember, I can do that because I'm essentially adding the same thing to both sides of this top equation.
The square root of 100. When you see it like this, this means the positive square root. If you're familiar with negative numbers, you know that there's also a negative square root, but when you just see this symbol, that means the positive square root.
The other thing that the stomach secretes is a chemical called lipase.
So 2 divided by 2 is 1. 4 divided by 2 is 2. So what fraction of an hour does he need to practice?
6 to the third times 6 to the sixth power, what is this going to be equal to?
You can divide it into 9.15 groups of 60 minutes.
So, in this problem, they're telling us in outer space, the distance an object travels varies directly with the amount of time that it travels. And, that's of course assuming that it's not accelerating, and there's no net force, and all of that on it. So, I guess they're talking about a specific object.
I'm going to tell you a little bit about my TEDxHouston Talk. I woke up the morning after I gave that talk with the worst vulnerability hangover of my life. And I actually didn't leave my house for about three days.
72.1 times 10 should be 721. But if we want to multiply it by 10 three times, we're going to move the decimal place over not just once, but twice, and three times. And you say wait, wait.
Well, negative 4 times x is just going to be negative 4x. And then they say-- so we're going to take that quantity, that's this thing right over here, and then they say add 9.
1 showed up seven times in this data set.
And if you really wanted to put it in the slope-intercept form, you could say that y is equal to-- you could just rearrange these-- 2.5x minus 7.5. You want the slope. It's right here.
The cofounder of the social, news, and entertainment website "Reddit" has been found dead. He certainly was a prodigy, although he never kinda thought of himself like that. He was totally unexcited about starting businesses and making money.
You get x is less than 27 over negative 3, which is negative 9. Or in interval notation, it would be everything from negative infinity to negative 9, not including negative 9. If you wanted to do it as a number line, it would look like this.
So this one over here, we can add 4 to both sides of the equation.
(Laughter) This is where I realized that there was really a need to communicate, because the data of what's happening in the world and the child health of every country is very well aware. We did this software which displays it like this: every bubble here is a country.
Another way you could think about it, you have to be divisible by both 2 and 5 to be divisible by 10. Here you are divisible by 5, but not 2. Obviously the easiest way is just to see if you have a zero in the ones place.
Recently I've developed a serious illness called Pulmonary Fibrosis - a hardening of the lung, as a side-effect of the transplant.
And you're always confused, well, do I multiply by 1,000, or do I divide by 1,000? And you always have to say, well, if I'm going from kilometers to meters, I'm going-- 1 kilometer is 1,000 meters, right? So I'm going to be multiplying by 1,000.
And to go from 100 to 300, we have to multiply by 3 in the denominator, so we have to multiply by 3 in the numerator as well. So 3/100 is the same thing as 9/300. And now we're ready to add.
You could look at it right over here. You have 8 eyes and 2 front eyes. That&amp;#x27;s 1 and 2.
The fact that it's in the tens place represents-- or the fact that the 4 is in the tens place shows that it represents 40. The fact that the 8's there shows that it represents 80.
1,2 Ga G for "Giga". So if you wanted the first thing that even resembled or was close to plants or animals and if you consider algae close to a plant, then this would be the winner of who got on land first.
[Sal] Well, thank you. That was fun.
And just to, I guess, complete the trifecta, the other way that we could write this is that dr is equal to-- if we just allowed these to cancel out, then we get is equal to dx times i plus dy times dy y times j. And that actually makes a lot of intuitive sense. That if I look at any dr, so let's say I look at the change between this vector and this vector.
And you could work this out in long division if you want to make sure that this works out, so let's keep going. And then we have 120 is equal to-- is 5 a factor? Is 5 times something equal to 120?
(Laughter) And I thought that was worth sharing.
So up by ten would be forty-six, and then one less than that is forty-five. But anyway, notice, the ones-- well, I'll talk more about it in the future. But we go from a nine, eight, seven, six, five on this digit, on the second digit.
One half minus one third, well that's the same thing as three over six minus two over six. Well that equals one over six. Let's do a bunch more problems and hopefully you'll start to get it.
Anyway, let's go back to this problem 15 is clearly greater than or equal to 8
So 5 of something plus 2 of that same something is going to be 7 of that something. So that's going to be 7x squared. And then let's look at the x terms here.
So one way to think about it, 78 divided by 0.15 is the same thing as 7,800 divided by 15, multiplying the numerator and the denominator by 100. So let's figure out what this is.
how true this again first-time there'll be a line on the film so if you can see the fat repeatedly complete but the problem all to the ground all of this has been in a frame of reference fixed to the year all of this motion locked in a frame of reference which was moving along with the car frame of reference like that well so that you can see what it looks like i'm going through solution camera so that it was with the car permittivity experiment again incidently i started and the number to stand here when the ball for all of you will have something which is fixed as a reference point
That is its prime factorization, 15 is 3 times 5, since both 3 and 5 are prime numbers. We can say that 6 is the same thing as 2 times 3. That's it, that is its prime factorization, since both 2 and 3 are prime.
So, that was for a line. And a line by definition has a constant slope. If you calculate this between any two points it's going to be con, any two points on the line, it's going to be constant for that line.
5 over 35-- I'm leaving some space so we can divide-- well, these are both divisible by 5, so let's divide the numerator and the denominator by 5. So if we divide the numerator by 5 and the denominator by 5, the numerator, 5 divided by 5 is 1, and then 35 divided by 5 is 7. So this thing is equivalent to saying that 1/4 is equal to 1/7, which is clearly not true.
0 minus 0 is 0.
You probably know the word "myriad" that means a bunch of thing or a huge amount, so myriapods - a huge amount of legs. And you might be familiar with the milipedes and centipedes, those are myriopods. So those first primitive myriapods 428 million years ago, and they would have lived off of plants and maybe other myriapods and other slugs or whatever other animals they would have found, might have looked something like that.
So 2/3 of M is still going to be greater than 2/3 of R. And you could even draw that in a number line if you like. Let's do this in a number line.
Sometimes I hear people respond to the disturbing facts of the climate crisis by saying, "Oh, this is so terrible. What a burden we have." I would like to ask you to reframe that. How many generations in all of human history have had the opportunity to rise to a challenge that is worthy of our best efforts?
So, this is 50 over 100 is 0.50 seconds And so now, let's answer the question, this life and death situation for the squirrel Will the squirrel make it 9 feet across the road before the car gets there
Well, in 6 years how old is Arman going to be? He's going to be 18 plus 6, we now know that this thing is 6 In 6 years, Arman is going to be 18 plus 6 which is 24 years old
And think about that, think about... if these were your dollar amounts in your bank account... ...would you rather have negative $40 in your bank account or negative $7 in your bank account? Negative 40 means that you owe the bank $40, so it's $40 less than having nothing.
1 plus 7 is 8-- 42,840. And now you can divide both sides by 210. Now we know where this is going to go.
1 times 210 is 210. You subtract.
Our question asks us, how many toothpicks will be needed to form the 50th figure in this sequence? So let's look at this sequence.
About a year ago, I asked myself a question:
77 plus 2 plus 3. If we have no parentheses here, this is actually the same thing as this over here, because we'd go 77 plus 2 is 79 plus 3 is 82. But the associative law tells as, well, you know what?
100 is 125% of 80.
You go to 2 to the third, you start with the 1, and then multiply it by 2 three times.
Along the y-axis, you have a scale from zero to 10, and along the x-axis, you have, of course, the five senses. Anytime I had a memorable experience in my life, I would record it on this graph like a five senses diary.
So then you have 8 hours is 480 minutes. And then you have 9 hours. Notice, I'm just adding 60 minutes every time.
Plus foury. And now we just solve this equation.
So what is 5 times 5?
So if I can convert the starting block into eighths, then I can copy it enough times to get exactly to 5/8, and exactly to 1 and 3/4, which is the same thing as-- 3/4 is the exact same thing as 6/8. So let's get our starting block into eighths. So if we're starting with 2 wholes, if we're starting with 2 units long-- So if I cut it once, now this is a whole unit.
So what's the smallest number that's a multiple of both 16 and 12?
Well, what you've just seen in the last few minutes is the story of 200 countries shown over 200 hundred years and beyond.
So one decameter-- we just saw deca means 10. That's 1 times 10 meters. So this is going to be equal to 10 meters.
When I call you and leave a message on your voice mail, I hear you saying, "Leave a message," and then I get these 15 seconds of freaking instructions,
If x is Ali's current age -- and here we say, in 4 years. So how old is Ali going to be in 4 years? Well, if x is his current age, in 4 years, he's going to be x plus 4 years old.
So it is going to be exactly that distance from 0 to the right. The length of this arrow, you could view it as 3 1/8th. Now, whenever I like to deal with fractions especially when I have different denominators i like to deal them with improper fractions, it makes the addition, and the subtraction, and actually the multiplication and divison a lot easier.
Let's start with a warm up ratio problem. So I have the ratio 13/6 is equal to 5/x.
16 - 4 is 12.
We are calling it length X. So, similar triangles - two ways to think about similar triangles. All of the corresponding angles are congruent and we see that here. This angle corresponds to that angle and they are the same.
So this is going to be equal to-- the easiest way I do it is you say, well, you divide 4 into 7. so you divide 4 into 7
Eight times nine is seventy-two. Stick a seven up there.
That's the longest side, the side opposite the 90 degree angle. You might say, hey, I don't know that's the longest side. I don't know what b is yet.
But that's the reason why if you want to divide it, if you want to go the other way-- if you have six things and you want to divide it into groups of two, you get three. If you have six and you want to divide into groups of three, you get two. Let's do a couple more problems.
Well, 27 is divisible by 3 And if you're unsure, you could add these digits right over here 2 plus 7 is equal to 9.
8 plus 3 is 11, and then this is going to be equal to-- well, 4 times 11 is just 44, so you can evaluate it that way.
(Motorcyle revving) [Sound]
27 times 6.
So this is going to be 7 plus-- and the 3 times 3 we want to do first. We want to do the multiplication first.
I bring to you a message from tens of thousands of people -- in the villages, in the slums, in the hinterland of the country -- who have solved problems through their own genius, without any outside help. When our home minister announces a few weeks ago a war on one third of India, about 200 districts that he mentioned were ungovernable, he missed the point. The point that we have been stressing for the last 21 years, the point that people may be economically poor, but they're not poor in the mind.
If one plane averages 400 miles/hour--so this is the airport.
(Laughter) Now the Apple guys are texting, "Develop odor emission plug-in."
that there is every possibility you will misunderstand me.
In the United States, since 2001 we've had five years of economic growth, five years of productivity growth in the workplace, but median wages are stagnant and the percentage of working families dropping below the poverty line is up by four percent. The percentage of working families without health care up by four percent. So this interdependent world which has been pretty good to most of us -- which is why we're all here in Northern California doing what we do for a living, enjoying this evening -- is profoundly unequal.
What's 0.3 times 1,000?
You can divide the 8 by 4 and get a 2.
Once again, 20 is 2 times 10, which is 2 times 5. So this is the same thing as the square root of 2 times 2, right, times 5.
800 plus 3 tens, or 30.
And then to go from 6 to 24, you have to multiply by 4, I'll do that in another color, so you have to multiply by 4 up here as well. So 4 times 13, let's see.
10 minus 1 is 9 3 minus 2 is 1 and we're going to have get this digit because we want to round to the nearest thousand.
25 goes into 100 exactly four times.
So if we write 76,830-- I'm going to try to color-code it. We could write this out as being the same thing as 70,000 plus 6,000-- the 7 is in the ten thousands place.
So we know we write 15% as a decimal, as 0.15, so 95 plus 0.15 of 95, so this is times 95-- that dot is just a times sign. It's not a decimal, it's a times, it's a little higher than a decimal-- So 95 plus 0.15 times 95 is what we have now, right? Because we started with ninety-five dollars, and then we made another fifteen percent times what we started with.
So let's subtract 2 from both sides of this equation, just like we did before. And actually, you can do these simultaneously, but it becomes kind of confusing.
I have come from so far to meet you like this. Please don't waste me. By working together, we can become one of those small, rapidly-growing groups of individuals who actually have the audacity and courage to believe that we actually can change the world.
Let's do some examples of solving equations. And you're going to see the equations in this video, they're not going to require a lot of steps, but I really want to focus on what's actually happening on the equation, and why it makes sense to do the steps that we're doing. So this first equation here, we have x-- I'll rewrite it
56 is going to become 5 and something, so it's going to become literally 5.6. Divide by 10 again, it's going to become 0.56. Divide by 10 again, you're like, wait.
"The laws of nature are but the mathematical thoughts of God." And this is a quote by Euclid of Alexandria. He was a Greek mathematician and philosopher who lived about 300 years before Christ
80 minus 72 is 8. Bring down another 0. I think we see a pattern forming again.
Model B is the exact same length as Model A.
(Applause) has a program called Kids Design Glass, and kids draw their own ideas for glass art. The resident artist said they got some of their best ideas from the program, because kids don't think about the limitations of how hard it can be to blow glass into certain shapes, they just think of good ideas. Now, when you think of glass, you might think of colorful Chihuly designs, or maybe Italian vases, but kids challenge glass artists to go beyond that, into the realm of brokenhearted snakes and bacon boys, who you can see has meat vision.
2 * 4/3 is the same thing as 8 * 1/3.
Well, you already built one of them with the 6. Then for every extra one-- so there's going to be 49 extra houses-- you're going to add 5 toothpicks apiece. So this is going to be equal to 6 plus 5 times 49.
So that's 1/2 right over there.
So we know the x-coordinate when y is equal to 0. So this is actually the x-intercept. So this point right over here is the point 2 comma 0.
Well, in y years Salman is going to be one hundred and eight plus y.
So we're going to add one extra 1,000. And now we just have 3,000 plus 1,000. This makes it the 4,000.
You divide by something is the same thing as multiplying by its inverse. So I'm multiplying by the inverse of 1/4.
As I ride out, as I ride my own inner strength, my own inner resilience, armed as I am with what medication can provide and continue treatment, as I ride out into the battlefield of cancer, asking my rogue cells to behave, I want to be known not as a cancer survivor, but as a cancer conqueror. I present to you an excerpt of that work
So, our LCM is 180. So, we want to rewrite all of these fractions with 180 in the denominator. So, our first fraction, 4/9, is what over 180?
India? How are you going to split your time going forward?
You just roll those two zeros at the end of it. And you say how many times does it go into a thousand. We know 16 times 5 is 80.
1225. So this tells us that a squared plus 441 is going to be equal to 35 squared, which is 1225. Now, we could subtract 441 from both sides of this equation.
150 is 25% of this number. And then you can solve for x. So let's just start with this one over here.
So change in y over change in x. So let's think about what this is going to be for this example right over here. Well, let's think about change in x first.
Let's add 536 to 398, and we're going to do it two different ways so you really understand what this carrying is all about. So first, we'll do it in the more traditional way. We start in the "one"s place, we say "what's 6 plus 8?"
It's not because Venus is slightly closer to the Sun. It's three times hotter than Mercury, which is right next to the Sun. Now, briefly, here's an image you've seen, as one of the only old images, but I show it because I want to briefly give you CSl:
You can now change your profile and header photos whenever you get the urge. These features are brought to you by our engineers and designers who hope you enjoy perfecting your profile! And on behalf of all of us here at Twitter:
20 doesn't go into 3, but it does go into 30 1 time. 1 times 20 is 20. Subtract, we get a 10.
So let's draw fourths. Let's draw literally 7 fourths and maybe it'll become clear.
Now, a lot of neoplasms, well they don't have to form a body like this. Sometimes they might somehow circulate in the body, but most of the time they form this kind of big lump. And if they get large enough, they're noticeable.
Well, 16 times 5, I know, is 80, so 16 times 50, I have multiplied by 10, is 800. And then I just subtract.
My story is a story of overcoming setbacks, obstacles and challenges that life throws at you. My story is the power of thought. My story is the power of choice.
Twenty times thirty-- you might not know-- is two times three and you have two zeros there. And I think I'm maybe jumping the gun a little bit, assuming a little bit too much of what you may or may not know. But twenty times thirty is going to be six hundred.
I thought I would do another example of partial quotient method for long division So there actually has some positives to do It's actually kind of fun to do
Well, we could say our Total Cost our Total Monthly Cost so this is for our trial plan right over here let me draw a dotted line over here to show well, the dotted line goes around there so under the trial plan our total cost is going to be equal to well, it's $12/session x # of sessions times S So under the trial plan I could say my total cost is equal to $12 x # of Sessions $12/session x the Number of Sessions
But if you do times 10 to the negative 2 power, you'll go 2 to the left. And you'd have to put a 0 here.
When x increases by 1, y decreases by 2.
So let's just solve for X in each of these constraints and keep in mind that any x has to satisfy both of them because it's an "and" over here so first we have this 5 x minus 3 is less than 12 so if we want to isolate the x we can get rid of this negative 3 here by adding 3 to both sides so let's add 3 to both sides of this inequality.
And I said, "This can't happen.
The other way you could have thought about this, you could have said that this is multiplying both sides of the equation times 1/7.
84 plus 7 is 91. It is 91. Did I do that right?
Well, 7 minus 2 is 5, so this is the same thing as the absolute value of 5.
4 is a single-digit number. So at least I got the y part right. But I need to write this part, which, in this form, this would be the x.
I did not have to convert them to realize that 35.7 % is smaller than 108.1 %, but now we have them both in decimals this 0.5 is already in a decimal we do not have to convert it then we have 13 93rds or 13 over 93 and the easiest way to convert this is literally perform the division
So that's one 1/4, 2/4, and 3/4. So we want one of those four to be filled in-- one of those four in orange. So one of those four to be filled in, just like that.
A baby's T-shirt requires 4/5 yards of fabric, or 4/5 of a yard of fabric. How many T-shirts can be made from 48 yards? So what we want to do is we essentially want to say how many groups of 4/5 of a yard can we make with 48 yards?
So what is 21 times 9? That's easier to do in your head. 20 times 9 is 180.
We have this system of equations here.
5 times itself six times. And 5 squared, that's just 5 times itself two times, so it's just going to be 5 times 5. Well, we know how to simplify a fraction or a rational expression like this.
"Pan-" for "entire" or "whole," and "-gaea," coming from "Gaia," for "the world." And it turns out that all of the evidence that we've seen actually does make us believe that there was supercontinent called — well, we call it Pangaea now, obviously there weren't things on the planet calling it anything back then, well, there were things back then, but not things that would actually go and try to label continents, that we know of, but all of the evidence tells us that Pangaea existed about 200 million to 300 million years ago — roughly maybe 250 million, give or take, years ago. And I want to be clear, this was not the first supercontinent.
So then we also know that this angle right here is 330 degrees. Right? Because this angle plus this magenta angle is going to equal the whole circle.
It's not less than 10 but negative 9 negative 9.999 we could include all of those things. The absolute value of any of those things is gonna be less than 10. So another way to write this, this absolute value inequality is that x could be, x could be greater than negative 10, x could be greater than negative 10 and x needs to be
Well, our x-coordinate, so x minus our x-coordinate is negative 3, x minus negative 3, and we're done. We can simplify it a little bit. This becomes y minus 6 is equal to negative 2/3 times x. x minus negative 3 is the same thing as x plus 3.
And in 1810, it was pretty crowded down there, wasn't it? All countries were sick and poor, life expectancy was below 40 in all countries and only the UK and the Netherlands were slightly better off, but not much.
"We will vote you out of office." He's out of office today.
It is this length right over here. It is DC. You could view it as the base of the entire parallelogram.
You get back to -3. So hopefully this starts to give you a sense of what it means to deal with or add and subtract negative numbers. But we are going to give a lot more examples in the next video.
I have one, two, three. I have three groups. But notice something, it's no coincidence that six divided by three is two, and six divided by two is three.
1 plus 0 is just 1. And then finally. You have the 6 in the hundreds place.
And what is negative 6/9? Well, if you simplify it, it is negative 2/3. You divide the numerator and the denominator by 3.
So we're given the following equation, that 5 times the absolute value of x plus 3 minus 3 is equal to 7. It's always a little daunting to see an equation with an absolute value sign.
And then after that, the only other information where they definitely tell us that two lines are intersecting at right angles are Line AB and WX. So Line AB is definitely perpendicular to Line WX.
9/39, they're both divisible by 3. So I can rewrite 9/39 as divide 9 by 3, it becomes 3. You divide 39 by 3, it becomes 13.
Now, every time I divide by 10, or if I multiply by 10 to the negative 1, I'm moving this over to the left one spot.
So I'm taking those same four objects. Instead of dividing them into groups of two, I want to divide them into groups of 1/2, which means each group will have half of an object in it. So let's say that would be one group right there.
1 times 68 is 68.
Somebody will receive them somewhere.
So that's equal to thirty-five girls.
Do a bar graph, go all the way up to five. 2 shows up five times.
Now we do it when t = 8, this expression becomes (5 * 8) + 3 = 40 + 3 = 43 so we have the last situation when t = 10 so we have ( 5 * 10) + 3 = 50 + 3 = 53 and we are done
I get these bubbly teenagers in trains who will say "Oh my god! Look at here face! Look at her face!
Now we can divide both sides by positive 5, that won't swap the inequality since 5 is positive.
So 6 is equal to 6 times 10 to the 0. You wouldn't actually have to write it this way. This is much simpler.
(Laughter) As you interact with someone at TED, maybe you can see a word cloud of the tags, the words that are associated with that person in their blog and personal web pages. In this case, the student is interested in cameras, etc.
Lets say you are an Ancient Philosopher who was building up mathematics who was building mathematics from the ground up And you already have a reasonable of what a negative number could or should represent and you know how to add and subtract negative numbers But now you are faced with a conundrum
Al-Gabr this is the root. This is the famous Algebra. This is where it shows up.
That's always the simplest type of pattern. So we went down by 6, we subtracted 6. Then to go from 9 to 3, well, we subtracted 6 again.
(Applause) CA: We are not to get involved politically and interfere in that way.
as far as you're concerned that time the karke wasn't necessarily moving at all that time when you couldn't see the background then i think perhaps it was harder for you to realize that you were in moving frame of reference important thing to realize here all frames of reference moving at constant velocity with respect to one another are equivalent doctor ivy showed you but the motion of the ball that was released from the moving karte looked like in the current frame of reference and in the car frame the motion looks simpler from a car now i want you to watch the motion white spot would probably be the clock moving out circle
(Laughter) And this, in many ways -- (Applause) -- is a symbol of the resilience of the Inuit people and of all indigenous people around the world.
LG: I can tell you many hopeful things that I've seen happening. But in the last year, where President Sirleaf comes from, her village, we went there to work with these girls.
3 times 2 is 6. That's positive 6. So that is equal to 0.
So, 15*12 = 180. Multiple numerator by same number, 13. We know 12*12 = 144, so just add one more 12 = 156.
This added to 1,893 is equal to 0.
So one times x is going to be the same thing as one times 0 We subsitute the 0 for x.
But, it's a good thing that wasn't because that would look very strange. Based on the information they gave us, these are the parallel and perpendicular lines.
(Laughter) But so did most of the flag-bearers, except Sophia Loren, the universal symbol of beauty and passion. Sophia is over 70 and she looks great.
Now, one final question. We're able to figure out the mass of X, can you figure out what the mass of Y is. Well we can go back to either one of these scales.
Something more rigorous---more than just simple feeling good about something or reasoning through it. "...I consulted Webster's Dictionary..." (so Webster's dictionary was around even in Lincoln's era) "...they told of certain proof---proof beyond the possibility of doubt. But I could form no idea of what sort of proof that was.
Put the four up here. Seven times seven, well, that's forty-nine. Plus four is fifty-three.
This is going to be 100 plus 9/300, which is 109/300. So this is the volume of ice that I now have expressed as a fraction.
That's pretty straight forward. 0 is right over there. once again, not too difficult. 2 is 2 to the right of 0.
And now you can subtract.
And you're taking the product of them, then this is the same thing as taking that same base, that 9, and raising it to the sum of the powers. So 9 to the 2 plus 2 plus 2, which is once again, 9 to the 6.
We're going from 9 to 4. Then we'd divide by 2 again to go from 2 to the second to 2 to the first. And then it seems like we should just divide by 2 again from going from 2 to the first to 2 to the 0.
We have 3x is equal to 225. To isolate the x, let's just divide both sides by 3.
You know, this is the north pole. And we call this the south pole. And there's another notion of magnetic north.
5 minus 1 is 4. 12 minus 4 is 8. 11 minus 4 is 7.
-3 minus -3 Anything minus itself should equal 0, right? That's why that equals 0
Now, to isolate the y, you can either multiply both sides by negative 1/12 or you could say let's just divide both sides by negative 12. Now, because I'm multiplying or dividing by a negative number here, I'm going to need to swap the inequality. So let me write this.
This distance is the same as that distance over there So that tells us that Z is exactly half way between X and Y So in this situation we would call Z the midpoint
I am trying to take to to an international level most of the people look on youtube and on youtube it is all around the world and i try to get different style from different people developed say koreo or latin countries america so where ever i can, I'm trying to learn from everywhere So Kool
Or you could say that this angle corresponds to this 120 degrees, so it is also 120, and make the same exact argument. This angle is the same as this angle, so it is also 120 degrees. Let's do another one.
91/12. Now, we've written both of them as improper fractions, but we still have different denominators, so we have to have a common denominator.
It has 300 options, I'm paying for 300; I'm using only three but I'm willing to live with it, therefore it is scaling up.
And to figure out what you have to multiply by 2 to get 120, well, you can think of 120 as 12 times 10, or another way to think about it, it's 2 times 6 times 10, or 2 times 60. You could divide it out if you want. You could say, OK, 2 goes into 120.
As it goes through S phase, these chromosomes replicate. And I'm just drawing the nucleus here. I've zoomed in on just this part right here, where N is 1, where our full diploid complement is two chomosomes.
(Laughter) And this non-profit group had a big welcoming lunch for all the new immigrants to Canada. And my dad says he got off the plane and he went to this lunch and there was this huge spread.
(Laughter) But the thing about tryptamines is they cannot be taken orally because they're denatured by an enzyme found naturally in the human gut called monoamine oxidase. They can only be taken orally if taken in conjunction with some other chemical that denatures the MAO.
To go from 27 to 9, you divide by 3.
Let's see if we can figure out 3 times 60. Well, there's a couple of ways you could think about it.
Calculate the sum of all positive divisors of 27 000
What's two times ten? And ten times tables are interesting. And we're going to see a pattern there in a second when we try to complete an entire times tables.
Well now we say, we could take 3 away from both sides. if I take 3 away from the left hand side I just have to take 3 away from the right hand side to keep my scale balanced. And I'll be left with the mass of Y is balance with a mass of 2 or Y is equal to 2. That's an analogy of taking 3 from both sides of this equation.
How many hours are in 549 minutes? And we can write it as a decimal or a fraction.
But the 5 times x and the negative 7 times actually can merge. So 5, you just add the coefficient. So, it's 5 and negative 7.
So, she's going to divide evenly the 15,000 mL into 8 pitchers So, that's straight up division
And it makes sense, because 15% is a very small percentage.
4 times 5 is 20.
Let's do some more systems of equations problem. In this video, we're going to encounter systems that might have no solutions, or that might have an infinite many solutions, and we'll label them with words. So let's start with one.
15 goes into 0 zero times.
In this video we're going to talk about another way of visualizing data called the histogram, which is a very fancy word for a not so fancy thing. I think it's probably fair to say that the histogram is the most used way of representing statistical data.
We wanna do the exponent before we worry about being subtracted, so this 5 squared over here, we can rewrite as 25.
8x minus 20x is negative 12x minus 5 is greater than or equal to-- we can merge these constant terms. Negative 1 minus 6, that's negative 7, and then we have this plus 8x left over.
3 to the third power is 27. And of course, we're trying to figure out what should 3 to the zeroth power be? Well, think about it.
Let me clear up some space here because I think we're going to be dealing with a lot of factors. So let me move this right here. Let me cut it and then let me paste it and move this over here so we have more space for our factors.
6 hours is 360 minutes.
Well, one times one would be one. And we have a negative times a negative. They cancel out.
So this gives us 10.4 and I'll right in the rate color.
"or you show this. But you don't do this." Because this is treating your audience like a moron.
15 does not go into 7, So you could do it zero times and you can do all that, or you can just say, OK, that's not going to give us anything.
"You build this, you build this, you put this, and it'll work." This is what it looks like today. Went to the roof, and all the women said, "Clear out.
25 does not go into 10.
Well, 3 and 9 are two separate bases, but 9 can actually be expressed as an exponent of 3, right?
3 times 3 is 9. Subtract, you got a remainder of 2. Bring down a 7.
4 and 1/2 yards, that gets us to this number right here: 27 divided by 2 is 13 and 1/2 feet. You multiply that by 12, it makes sense.
The absolute value of -3 plus the absolute value of -7. But we're to the left of zero (we've been moving to the left) so it's the negative of that which is -10 So if your signs are the same, you can just take the absolute value of them say "ok, that's how far we're going to move, total. and we're that far from zero to the left"
So I want to get rid of this negative 2 on the left-hand side. The best way I know how to do that is to add 2 to both sides. So add a 2 on the left-hand side.
So 14,897 is the same thing as 10,000 plus 4,000 plus 800 plus 90 plus 7. So you could consider this expanded form, or you could use this version of it, or you could say this the same thing as 1 times 10,000, depending on what people consider to be expanded form-- plus 4 times 1,000 plus 8 times 100 plus 9 times 10 plus 7 times 1. I'll scroll to the right a little bit.
And if you wanted to write this as a mixed number, you could just say, well, 8 goes into 27 three times, and you have a remainder of 3. So this is equal to 3 and 3/8. And you see that on the ruler right over here.
I'm thinking about getting a life insurance because I have a mortgage, and I have a young son and another baby on the way.
Now another way to think about this is this is just like saying this is 4 thousands plus-- or you could even think of "and"-- so plus 3 hundreds plus 50, you could think of it as 5 tens plus 6.
And yet, despite the enormous disparities today, we have seen 200 years of remarkable progress. That huge historical gap between the West and the Rest is now closing. We have become an entirely new converging world, and I see a clear trend into the future, with aid, trade, green technology, and peace.
So if we have 4/5 here, that'll be 5/4, the reciprocal. Now, you still might say, hey, I have a whole number here and a fraction, and you just have to remember any whole number can be written as a fraction. This is the same thing as 48/1 times 5/4.
Let's look at relationship B. There's a 12.5% discount for every item at Crazy Joe's.
I've written out two numbers here, and they both contain 4. They each have 4 as a digit, and I want to think about what the values of these 4's are and to actually compare them.
(Applause) But nothing, nothing prepared me for what I was to hear on the first of July 2008. I heard the word "carcinoma."
But there's another way, and I'll leave you with this. This is what I have found: To let ourselves be seen, deeply seen, vulnerably seen ... to love with our whole hearts, even though there's no guarantee -- and that's really hard, and I can tell you as a parent, that's excruciatingly difficult -- to practice gratitude and joy in those moments of terror, when we're wondering, "Can I love you this much?
You could say 10 goes into 39, I'll even write it out, 10 goes into 39 3 times, 3 times 10. And you want to find the largest number of times 10 goes into this without going over. So you couldn't write a 4 over here, because then that would be 40.
What is 10 to the 1 power? Well that's equal to 10.
So the average of these four numbers is equal to 7.25.
6 times one is 6 plus one is 7. And then you subtract and get twelve.
It's 48 away from to 200 than it to 100.
For those of you who saw "An Inconvenient Truth," the most important slide in the Gore lecture is the last one, which shows here's where greenhouse gases are going if we don't do anything, here's where they could go. And then there are six different categories of things we can do to change the trajectory. We need a movie on those six categories.
So let's see three. (3, -2).
And then this 8 divided by 4 is going to be, this'll be 2x plus 3. That's one way to do it. Or you could do it this way.
We're asked to simplify 8 plus 5 times 4 minus, and then in parentheses, 6 plus 10 divided by 2 plus 44. Whenever you see some type of crazy expression like this where you have parentheses and addition and subtraction and division, you always want to keep the order of operations in mind. Let me write them down over here.
So, this, literally, could be 1, a width of 1, and a length of 24, 1 times 24 is 24. And, they tell us that the length, that, that the length is longer, the length is wong, longer than the width, that the table is longer than it is wide. So, we want the larger number under length.
And 10 to the fifth, that's multiplying five 10's. And then you're dividing by four 10's. You're going to have one 10 left over.
So we can say triangle ADC is congruent to triangle, so we want to get this right. So it's going to be congruent to triangle, I said ADC.
You are left with a remainder of 12. We might say how do we know how many times does 16 go into 1388? Well it goes 50 times plus 20 times plus 10 times plus 5 times plus 1 time.
95, right?
So let me get my little notepad and write it out. So he literally took 2/5, and he attempted to multiply it by 7. And he said that this is the same thing as taking the 2 times the 7, over the 5 times the 7.
Add. Simplify the answer and write as a mixed number.
So r is definitely not 2/63rds times p, r is 9 over 14 times p. So we'll go with that one right over there. And then finally, they solve...they're solving for 14 over 9.
So if you were to add the two measures of these, so let me write this down, the measure of angle MNO plus the measure of angle XYZ, is equal to, this is going to be equal to 120 degrees plus 60 degrees. Which is equal to 180 degrees, so if you add these two things up, you're essentially able to go halfway around the circle. Or throughout the entire half circle, or a semi-circle for a protractor.
What underpinned this shame, this "I'm not good enough," -- which, we all know that feeling:
Give a good applause!
Now what is 10 minus 2.35?
We're asked to construct a 10 degree angle. So we have this little angle tool here that we can use to construct an angle.
Negative 2 minus 1, which is equal to negative 3. Notice we went down 3. And then what is going to be our change in x?
We said this is 8 meters, and notice I have 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 meters. And the same thing along this side. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 meters.
The number and order of these four bases determine for example, whether you're a chimp, a cow, a banana, or a human.
And then finally we have this 10 over here. which was the absolute value of 5 minus 15. And we are done.
PM: Yeah. Yes, yes, of course.
Find the perimeter of the parallelogram. We have a parallelogram right over here, opposite sides are parallel. That side is parallel to that side right over here.
And then we can get rid of this 7 here by subtracting 7 from both sides. So let's subtract 7 from both sides. Left-hand side, y plus 7 minus 7, those cancel out, we just have a y.
So '4 x 24 = 96' So William is a senior, we should call him Mr. William. He is 96 years old.
And 48 of the 64, you could imagine splitting this up into 64 super-small pieces.
They want us to do it again. OK, let's see. So this top expression, everything is divisible by 3, so let's rewrite it.
I wanted it all -- home office, sit down dinner for 10, room for guests, and all my kite surfing gear. With over 300 entries from around the world, I got it, my own little jewel box.
So let's say two and one fourth. If we use the-- I guess you'd call it a system that I just showed you-- that equals four times two plus one over four. Well that equals, four times two is eight plus one is nine.
(Laughter) (Applause) Thank you.
pieces in the pie, then I have to eat twice as many pieces to eat the same amount of pie. Let's do some more examples of equivalent fractions and hopefully it'll hit the point home. Let me erase this.
If I do 1 times 10 to the negative 2 10 to the negative 2 is 1/10 squared or 1/100 so this is going to be 1/100 which is 0.01 What happened here? When I read it to the negative power
So 24 squared minus 12 squared is equal to 24.78. So this actually turns into-- let me do it without a-- well, I'll do it halfway.
So it looks like her score improved by 10 points, so 10 points. Let's try one more. How many students improved their scores from the midterm to the final exam?
4 you can actually break it down as 2 times 2. Now with that out of the way lets think about some larger numbers, and think about whether those larger numbers are prime.
Well, once again, twelve times positive four would be fourty-eight. And we are in the circumstance where one of these two numbers, right over here, is negative. This one right here.
I don't know whether I should educate her, or whether I should just get up and go to another compartment, or I should just shout. I don't know. I would like to show you all some images asking very pertinent questions.
1/10 might be over here. Everything less than or equal to 1/10. So we're going to include the 1/10 and everything less than that is included in the solution set.
Multiples of 6 - 6,12,18,24,30... i can keep going and the multiples of 8 are 8,16,24,. looks like we are done. I have found a common multiple it is the smallest multiple they have other common multiples like 48,72 and we can go on but this is their smallest common multiple So it is 24.
We would call it AD and we would put this little arrow over on top of it To show that is a ray And in this case it matters the order
54 is equal to 12 times the number of session. So now I have set this equation. In order to answer this question.
Let's say we had a triangle that looks like this.
When you get 0 equals 0, or 1 is equal to 1 or anything like that, you're dealing with the dependent system. Which really means that these are the exact same lines, even though they might look a little bit different. And to verify that, let's put them both into slope-intercept form.
All told, you've nearly 20,000 genes, your genes are small parts of a long molecule, called DNA, or deoxyribonucleic acid.
We're going, we're going 8 in the positive direction. So we're getting less negative, and negative 32 is greater than negative 48. It's less negative.
0 times 16 is 0. You subtract, and you get a 4. And we're not satisfied just having this remainder.
So this is going to be-- let's see, 15 times 3 is 45. 45 times 4 is 180 cubic meters. That's the boxcar volume.
And so these are all Flickr images, and they've all been related spatially in this way. We can just navigate in this very simple way.
15 goes into 30 exactly two times.
So that's how many apples they purchased, so he got back to M. Now, if R, if River Orchards also purchased a apples, that same distance, a, if you go along here gets you to right about over there. So once again, this is-- let me do it a little bit different, because I don't like it overlapping, so let me do it like this.
The last pictures I'd like to show you are of an iceberg that I photographed in Qeqetarsuaq, Greenland. It's a very rare occasion that you get to actually witness an iceberg rolling. So here it is.
You divide both sides by 15 you get y is equal to 225 over 15, which is equal to 15. Now we're not completely done yet. We know what y is, but we still have to solve for x.
How many 0's does the product 67 times 10 to the fifth have? Well, there's a bunch of ways of thinking about that.
These puppets are made out of recycled World Bank reports.
And then you bring down this 5.
Negative 2 times negative 2 is positive 4, and then positive 4 times negative 2 is negative 8. So this would be equal to negative 8. Now, another way of thinking about exponents, instead of saying you're just taking three negative 2's and multiplying them, and this is a completely reasonable way of viewing it, you could also view it as this is a number of times you're going to multiply this number times 1.
7 times 6 is 42, plus 4, is 46, so the 0 now, cause we're now in, we're now moved up, to, we've moved a space to the left, so now we have 6 times 7 is 42, Carry the 4.
Now, this might seem very daunting, but if we just simplify it step by step, you'll see it's no harder than any of the other problems we've tackled. So let's just simplify this. You get 8x minus-- let's distribute this negative 5.
2(x+4)=x+7. We can distribute this two, so we get 2x+8=x+7. We can subtract x from both sides of this equation, and we can subtract 8 from both sides of this equation.
So that is our number line. Maybe this is 0, this is 1, this is 2, 3, maybe that is negative 1. So x can be greater than or equal to 2.
And 64 times 8-- 4 times 8 is 32.
Then you think you have been cheated, this beggar has been trying to prove himself an emperor. Now this is absolutely absurd -- you were thinking of him as an emperor.
And still I am not full of guilt or my self-worth is not low. And infact even though I have lost two precious human beings, I have a greater sense of peace and equanimity.
You have been told to sacrifice yourself for some idiotic ideal.
I'm an American; I don't believe in philosophy. (Laughter) This is a fact -- or, as we say in my hometown of Washington, D.C., a true fact.
What's 27.5 times 2?
And one interesting thing to think about is "should this number be larger or smaller than 150"? Well, if we only take 25% of that number, if we only take 25/100 of that number If we only take 1/4th of that number, because that's what 25% is, we get 150.
My fear is of dying or going cuckoo. Most probably cuckoo, because in let-go nobody is going to die. A few people will shout "Yaa-Hoo!"
I will end up with one, two groups. So that's another way to think about division. And this is an interesting thing.
4x squared is 2x squared. And then 1 is obviously 1 squared. So we can write this as a plus b times a minus b.
We get the absolute value of 2 times negative 3, minus 5. should be equal to 11. So what's 2 times negative 3?
Subtract 8 from both sides. The left hand side, we're just left with a 4y, cuz these guys cancel out.
I replied that surely this was a case of mistaken identity because I'm as far as you can get from being an athlete. Actually, I wasn't even sure that I could go around the stadium without a walker.
10 to the seventh. Now, what is 7 divided by 5?
Express 0.0000000003457 in scientific notation So let's just remind ourselves what it means to be in scientific notation Scientific notation will be some number times some power of 10
How many times does 210 go into 2,079? It looks like it would go into it not quite 10 times. It looks like it would go into it nine times.
Let's say that this side over here is 7 centimeters. And let's say that the height right here is 4 centimeters. So what is the area of this rectangle going to be?
Maybe 'A' sits right over here, and 'C' sits right over there. And then also let's say we have another angle called DAB, actually let me call it DBA, I want to have the vertex once again at 'B'.
What's 16 divided by 4? It is 4. And then multiply that by 3, it's 12, just multiplying fractions.
So you have 4 times negative 10 which is negative 40 plus 8, negative 40 plus 8 should be greater than negative 48.
We got minus 1/6 and the original problem was minus 1/2 x, so we substitute minus 1/6, plus 3/4. I only wrote the left hand side of the original problem.
8 times 9 is 72. That's too big. So it goes into it eight times.
0.2 times x is equal to 4. And now we have a level one linear equation. I bet you didn't expect to see that.
Our change in y is positive 3.
Let's see, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. I have 6 pieces.
So eleven times eleven is going to be eleven more than eleven times ten. So we add eleven to this.
And another plane averages 250 miles per hour.
5, well, 5 is only divisible by 1 and 5, so 5 is prime.
A.D. And Algebra is the Arabic word that here is the actual title that he gave to it which is the Arabic title
So that's ten to the fifth power, right? Right.
One, two, three groups of four. So twelve divided by four is equal to three. And we can do the exercise that we saw on the previous video.
5 was a little bit harder to do in your head. but 120, you could say, well, 12 divided by 6 is 2, and then you have that 0 there, so 120 divided by 6 would be 20. And you could work it out in long division if you like. So 6 times 20 are two more factors.
I don't know the exact number.And looks like on the final she got,I don't know that looks like maybe a 77 or 78,approximately.So she improved a little bit about 5 points from the mid-term to the final.The way they have given us this information we don't know the exact numbers, because it isn't super precise in terms of marking off the bars. Hopefully it will become obvious when we look through everyone's scores Lets look at Jeff.
If that's -7 then maybe this right over here would be -10. Notice we go further and further to the left of the zero, and then we go a little bit further to the left we get -25... A little bit further to the left than that is -30.
So at 3 o'clock, 61 minutes have passed. And so if we, if we say well how many more minutes have to go on for the end of the test?
Let's clear this and now I'm going to attempt to type.
So if you were to count them all out, you'd have 7 times 4 square centimeters. It's 4 centimeters. So it's equal to 28 centimeters square or squared centimeters.
left with x. On the left hand side, 9*2/3 = 18/3 = 6 So these are all legitimate ways of doing this.
So 1,2,3 3 times 291 is 873. 3000, is 873000 Let me write this a little bit neater
But this they're saying Todd is older than Marta, so t is greater than m. And Todd is younger than Susan, so t is less than s, so that's just choice A. Problem number three.
You're multiplying both sides by n so that you get 8n.
-40 would be the coldest temperature, and -7 would be the warmest temperature.
Alan found 4 marbles to add to his 5 marbles currently in his pocket. He then had a competition with his friends and tripled his marbles. Write a numerical expression to model the situation without performing any operations.
25 plus another 2-- 4 times 27, which is 9 times 3. So what do we have here?
So the number of wholes, or you can imagine, the number of whole pies.
7 times 8 is 56. And then we subtract again.
7 doesn't go into 1.
91 times 3,600 divided by 5,280 -- 62.05! So that equals 62.05 miles per hour.
Well, we multiply nine times four to get thirty-six. We have to multiply the numerator times four as well.
I could keep adding things above and below 32.
So one-fifth of the blocks over here in Model A is pink. Now we have to think about how to make one-fifth pink right over here. So let's think about it.
Line WX. And, I think we are done.
And 99 over a 1,000 is the same thing as 495 over 5,000. So you have the same numerator in each in the, you have the same denominator, but this numerator is larger.
9 times 6, or 6 times 9 is 54. 54 plus 5 is 594. So this right here is 594.
In November of 2003, I was invited to take part in the launch of Nelson Mandela's 46664 Foundation -- that is his HlV/AlDS foundation. And 46664 is the number that Mandela had when he was imprisoned in Robben Island.
121 will not go into 120. So the largest factor on our factors list is going to be 120. Now let's think about others.
Bring down the 0.
-8 times -8 times -8
8+7. And this time I'm not going to start at 0, I'll start at like 5, because, you know, if you keep going you'll get to 0 eventually. So let's see you get 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, and so on
Negative 2 plus 3 is 1. Or another way of saying it, if I have 3x squared and I were to take away 2 of those x squared, so I'm left with the 1x squared. So this right over here simplifies to 1x squared.
Now, we can just add 3 to both sides to get rid of that constant term 3 on left hand-side. These two 3's will cancel out. And you get minus 3x is equal to 11.
Well, 1,900 times 1 over 100 is 19, so this is equal to 19 meters. Another way of thinking about it is, this is 19 groups of 100 centimeters, and 100 centimeters is equal to a meter. This is 19 meters right over here.
My handwriting is- so this is going to be 3000 3000 times 291 Let me make sure. This is a 2 right over here.
So let's see, I did 0.0000516. I wanted to represent this in scientific notation. I'd go to the first non-digit 0, the first non-zero digit, not non-digit 0, which is there.
So literally we're talking 7 x equals 14 things These are equivalent statements Now, the reason why I drew it that way is to you really understand what we will do when we
(Laughter) Went to Afghanistan. One lesson we learned in India was men are untrainable.
Osho, I call you "Beloved Master" but still I escape.
(Laughter) And the last story I'm going to talk about is quite a story.
I encourage you to pause this video and try to figure out what the measure of this angle right over here is. Well, let's think about where the rays intersect the circle. They intersect there and there.
And what's 1 plus 0.25? That's easy, it's 1.25.
Let's review a little bit of what Napoleon was up to going into the war of the Third Coalition, which really does establish Napoleon as the dominant figure in Europe. So in 1799, he takes power. First with two other consuls, but then he declares himself First Consul.
Well, there's a couple of ways to think about it. twenty percent is exactly one / five. And four times five is twenty. That makes sense.
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven. And that's the same thing as seven plus seven, which you may or may not know is equal to fourteen. You could just say hey, that's going to be two more than twelve.
Does 2 go into 75?
Well, the same idea is going to happen. We're now taking 10 times more so we're going to move to the decimal to the right once. So, a hundred stamps are going to cost, are going to cost $44.00.
Lets say we have one ray over here that starts at point A and then goes through point B, and so we could call this ray (we could call, let me draw that a little bit straighter) we could call this ray AB. Ray AB
So you do 16 divided by 4 is 4.
Well, we literally have 6/5 here.
3 times something divided by 3 is just the something. So you're left with x is equal to, and then 12 divided by 3 is 4.
[ending music]
The bottom line is ninety-five is less than one hundred. So fifteen percent of ninety-five had to be less than fifteen, so I knew my answer of 15.25 was wrong. And so it turns out that I actually made an addition error, and the answer is 14.25.
You could say for every group, there are two boys. There's eight groups. There's sixteen boys.
So we can write 3 here Now, I keep talking about another technique, let me show you the other technique, and that involves the prime factorization
Let's do ninety-nine times eighty-eight. That's going to give us a big number!
We are asked what is 10 to the fifth power equivalent to.
When we multiply two times three, we get six. When we multiply three times two, we will get six. So we should have the same property here.
You show me a man who can sit with a woman who's just had it, she can't do it all anymore, and his first response is not, "I unloaded the dishwasher!" (Laughter)
Fifty percent of it is coming from America. Because we discovered that people care, and people would like to know -- they are receiving the stream through our Internet. Unfortunately in the United States, we are not covering but Washington D.C. at this moment in time for Al Jazeera English.
8+7 -- I'll tell you, frankly, even to this day, I sometimes get confused with 8+7. So let's-- If you know the answer then you already know how to do this problem, you can just write whatever the answer is right here.
"Maybe we should live with this kind of authoritarian situation that we find ourselves in, instead of having the second scenario." That was one of the worst nightmares that we have seen. For 10 years, unfortunately we have found ourselves reporting images of destruction, images of killing, of sectarian conflicts, images of violence, emerging from a magnificent piece of land, a region that one day was the source of civilizations and art and culture for thousands of years.
Based on the data below which student's score improved the most between the mid-term and final exam? And so they give us this data in terms of a bar graph for each student.We actually have two bars that show the mid-term in blue and then final exam in red. and they tell us that here,mid-term in blue,and final exam(in red) -and sometimes this is called a two column bar graph,because for each student here,you have two columns of data.So if you were to actually look at the data its self,you have the mid-term data and then the final exam data.Now,they are asking us,"which student's score improved the most between the mid-term and the final exams?"So,if we look at Jasmin right over here,might as well start with her since she might as well start with her since she is the most to the left.It looks like she definitely did improve from the mid-term to the final
So in either case, we're multiplying times 5, the numerator and the denominator.
And to add these two fractions, we have to find the least common multiple of 4 and 8. That'll be our new denominator.
We're asked to write this right here in word form, and I'm not saying it out loud because that would give the answer away. We have 63.15 that we want to write in word form.
He still needs to practice 1 and 2 out of the fourths, 2/4. Now, 2/4, we know, is the same thing as 1/2. There's a couple of ways to think about it.
And you'll see that if you know all your multiplication tables from one to nine, so you know any number between one and nine times any other number between one and nine, you can actually do any multiplication problem out there. But what I want to do now is I want to complete the multiplication tables for ten, eleven, and twelve.
Nine divided by four is two remainder one.
Welcome to the presentation on ratios. Now, I'm going to start just giving you a definition of ratios, and this I got from Wikipedia. "A ratio is a quantity that denotes the proportional amount of magnitude of one quantity relative to another." So I'm going to tell you from the beginning that I think a ratio is something that's easier to understand than to give a definition for because I don't think that Wikipedia definition is that useful.
So if I had a line like this.
6 times 5 is 30.
We go up by 3. delta x. delta y.
There are three groups of influenza viruses which we call virus types. And these three types are influenza A, B and C. So we group influenza viruses like this because of the differences that they have in genetic material or their genome.
So this thing right here-- simplify 16 divided by 4 times 2. It simplifies to 4 times 2. That's this thing in green right there.
0 × 27 is 0. [Not "10," as Sal states by mistake.] Subtract - we have a remainder of 10.
They said, "Yes." I said, "All right, let's pray." I prayed for them, and things started to change. This is a visual of education inside the prison.
Unfortunately, they're almost half German, they're so precise.
I'll write it this way, boys to girls is four:seven. What I want to know is, how many girls do I need to add.
So, varies inversely as the frequency. So L is going to be equal to some constant times the inverse of the frequency. Times the inverse of the frequency.
Let's now talk about what is easily one of the most famous theorems in all of mathematics. And that's the Pythagorean theorem. And it deals with right triangles.
What's the second term?
We have one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve, thirteen, and we have to include this one, fourteen. five times ten to the minus fourteenth power. Now this number, it might be a little overkill to write this in scientific notation, but it never hurts to get the practice. So what's the largest ten that goes into this?
(Laughter) FN: And I brought this all together, this passion with alternative energy and raced a solar car across Australia -- also the U.S. and Japan.
We just write that out algebraically. eighty-five years ago, Tarush is fivex minus eighty-five. And the sentence tells us that he was ten times older than Arman, who is x minus eighty-five.
Use the associative law of multiplication to write-- and here they have 12 times 3 in parentheses, and then they want us to multiply that times 10-- in a different way. Simplify both expressions to show they have identical results.
All right, so I got a collection of the paintings together and I looked at them and I deconstructed them and I put them back together. And so, here's the design, right? And so here's the front and the spine, and it's flat.
We have negative 3z is less than or equal to 18.
Let's try negative 1 to the first power. Well, anything to the first power, you could view this-- and I like going with this definition as opposed to this one right over here. If we were to make them consistent, if you were to make this definition consistent with this, you would say hey, let's start with a 1, and then multiply it by 1 eight times.
Use the commutative law of multiplication to write 2 times 34 in a different way. Simplify both expressions to show that they have identical results. So once again, this commutative law just means that order doesn't matter.
We have 11x plus 12 over 2. Just like here. We could say, this is the same thing as 11-- We could write it as 11 over 2x, if we like.
We are asked, what is the value of the 100th term in this sequence? And the first term is 15, then 9, then 3, then negative 3. So let's write it like this, in a table.
So it's 7 ten thousands, which is 70,000, plus-- the 6 is in the thousands place-- so it's 6,000, or 6 thousands, one could say, plus 800.
Well, it would be half the perimeter.
7 times 3 is 21. 22 minus 21 is 1. Bring down the 5.
So now lets think about the O negative case
So let's say I had the repeating decimal zero point seven and sometimes it'll be written like that. [bar above the seven] Which just means that the 7 keeps on repeating.
And you'll see that 2Xs are gonna be 6kg plus my Y is 2kg that will balance 8kg.
I wanted to read you a quick, very short poem from W. B. Yeats, who some of you may know. He wrote this to his love, Maud Gonne, and he was bewailing the fact that he couldn't really give her what he thought she wanted from him. And he says, "I've got something else, but it may not be for you."
Over here, to get from 3 to 12, we have to multiply the denominator by 4. So we also have to multiply the numerator by 4. So we get 8.
And we already see that 210 goes into 1,800 ninety-nine times.
4 and 1/2 yards. Now, whenever we're dealing with fractions and we're going to multiply and divide by fractions, it really complicates the issue to have a mixed number. So right from the get go, I want to turn this into an improper fraction.
So the first one they might want to say is well, a circle is all of the points that are equal distant from the center of the circle. All of these points along the edge are equal distant from that center right there. So one of the first things someone might want to ask is what is that distance, that equal distance that everything is from the center?
The ratio of the circumference of the diameter was this kind of magical number, they gave it a name. They called it pi, or you could just give it the Latin or the Greek letter pi -- just like that.
So that's going to be 10 tenths. Plus the 1 tenth that was already there, gives us 11 tenths. Or if we have no ones, well, 2.1 is the same thing as 21 tenths.
Then if we look at BC right over here, BC corresponds to its between the two bars and the three bars, it corresponds to EF.
And if you think of it 2 and 8 both divide into 16 [Sal] Absolutely
How is this possible? (Laughter) It makes no sense.
Distribute the negative 1/5, so you get negative 2/25 m, and then negative 1/5 times 500 is minus 100. Let's simplify this even more. The left-hand side is still 33 over 50 m is equal to-- And now we have we have these coefficients on our m terms, right here.
12,715,430. If I were to write this in scientific notation as 1.271543 times 10 to the seventh. And when you write it this way, you say, hey, well, yeah, if I was to really estimate this and get pretty rough with it, and I just rounded this down,
This is the exact same thing as 1/2 times 3/4. So to imagine where this gets us, let's draw ourselves a number line.
But if you want to grow your treasures, share them,
95 times 0.15-- I don't want to run out of space.
It goes into it eight times. I happen to know that in my head, but you could do trial and error and think about it. eight times-- if you want to think about it, eight times one hundred is eight hundred, and then eight times twenty-five is two hundred, so it becomes one thousand. You could work out if you like, but I think I'm running out of time, so I'm going to do this fast. eight times one hundred and twenty-five is one thousand.
Abe went running 4 days this past week, he ran 9 kilometers on each day In that same week Beth ran 15 fewer kilometers than Abe, how many kilometers did Beth run that week? So I encourage you to pause this video and to try this on your own.
Most people today live in the middle. But there are huge differences at the same time between the better off countries and the worse off countries and there are also huge inequalities within countries. These bubbles show country averages, but I can split them.
16 minus 7- I have multiple of videos on how to borrow if I'm doing that part too fast But the idea here is to show you a different way of long division
Let's say I have one fourth plus one half. Let's go back to that original pie example. Let me draw that pie.
7 is not divisible by 3, so 25 will not be divisible by 3. So we keep moving up: 5.
Negative one / five. On the left-hand side we have x. And on the right-hand side we have negative thirty-four / five.
But some small groups are more geographically or culturally isolated, and remain genetically distinguishable.
Well, 1 gram is equal to 10 decigrams. And the reason why this makes sense is if we have a decigram in the numerator here, we want a decigram in the denominator here.
So she pays $48 per month for each of the five web servers. And she pays $60 a month for each of the two database servers. So if you wanted to write an expression that describes the monthly hosting bill for n web servers and m database servers, well, you see here, you see this pattern.
The easiest way to think about it is: If I want one X on this left-hand side, that is a third of the total X's here. So what if I were to multiply the left-hand side by one-third --
Divide both sides by 0.8, or 0.80, depending how you want to view it. 0.80. These cancel out.
Well, we have filled in 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. So this is also equal to 5/2. So far we just did it thinking about what multiplication actually means.
so A is vertex. Not only is it the vertex of each of these rays, ray AB and ray AC, it is also the vertex
75 plus 225 is 300. So it looks like we increased by another 75. So the pattern here is that each year, 75 more students attend the Einstein School.
Since 2 is a positive number, we don't have to swap the inequality. So let's just divide both sides by 2, and we get x is greater than negative 4 divide by 2 is negative 2. So the solution will look like this.
Or up and down, you could also move in and out of the screen You can also have this dimension that I'll try to draw You could go into the screen or you could go out of the screen like that
Well, let's see, if I multiply 9 by itself, that's only going to be 81.
Today, we can write a word such as TED in Egyptian hieroglyphics and in cuneiform script, because both of these were deciphered in the 19th century. The decipherment of these two scripts enabled these civilizations to speak to us again directly. The Mayans started speaking to us in the 20th century, but the Indus civilization remains silent.
Man: Future's over here. Wind, sun, a new energy grid.
And now, what are the common factors? Well, 1 is a common factor. 3 is also a common factor
The perimeter of a rectangular fence measures 0.72 kilometers. The length of the fenced area is 160 meters. What is its width?
Every integer shares that common factor. But the number 2.
(Laughter) Atlassian is an Australian software company. And they do something incredibly cool.
12 divided by 3 is 4. So 3/12 is the same thing is 1/4. Now let's try do the same thing for 5/35.
So a few videos ago I told you that anything to the 0 power is equal to 1. So x to the zeroth power is equal to 1. And I gave you one argument why this is the case
60 goes into 90 1 time.
The message that UNAlDS are currently sending out to the world is that we would like to see the virtual elimination of the transmission of the virus from mother to child by 2015. It's a very ambitious goal but we believe it can be achieved with political will. This can happen.
And if you divide 8 by 8, you get 1. So this rate simplifies to, this price per office, I guess we could call it, simplifies to $35 for every 1 office, which we could also write as 35 over 1 dollars per office, which is the exact same thing as $35 per office. And we're done.
A square has 4 sides and 4 right angles, and all of the sides are equal. So let me draw a square here. My best attempt.
But even though its been over 15 years since my husband and son died I still hanker after the small things of life- A warm cuddle from my husband, nagging from my son and their sense of humour.
I am actually getting a term life policy.
You read the next question now
4/4 is one whole.
I can exactly divide twelve objects into three groups of four.
Nine times six, fifty-four. That was this one as well.
So the best way to cancel out a negative 3 is to add 3. So it cancels out to 0. So we're going to add 3 to the left, let's add 3 to the right.
Let's do a few more examples of solving equations. And I think you're going to see that these equations require a few more steps than the ones we did in the last video.
The fourth term, we have a 3. The third term, we have a 2. The second term, we have a 1.
And then finally, 150 over 100, well, we're multiplying the denominator by 3 to get to 300, to go from 100 to 300. So we have to do the same thing in the numerator.
So it goes into it five times.
And let's say I wanted to find the area and let's say I know one side over here is 2.
So the Awesome story: It begins about 40 years ago, when my mom and my dad came to Canada. My mom left Nairobi, Kenya.
1 minus negative 2
Negative 4 plus 11 is the same thing as 11 minus 4, is indeed 7. Let's do this one here. This one looks a little bit more difficult, but you're going to see, it's not too bad.
That's where we put a 2. And then all of that squared. Well 1 squared is just 1, so that is just 1.
and let's say I divide it into 4 equal parts.
We know that, 6.7 is less than the square root of 45, and we know that, that is less than 6.71 cause when we square this we get something a little bit over the square root of 45.
15 times 15 is 225. So 1.5 times 1.5 is 2.25.
1500 to 1800: maybe a little bit of economic growth, but less in a century than you expect to see in a year today.
As you can see everyone, 95% of the oil effluences are removed in the very first attempt itself.
7 goes into 51. I put the 7 right above the 1 in the 51's place. So 7 goes into 28.
4 of something plus 3 of something will be equal to 7 of the something. Anyway, hopefully, you found that useful.
10 times 6 is equal to 60 square units.
From four to six we're going plus two. And then from six to eight we're going plus two. So you could figure out what two times five is, even without doing the addition.
If I asked you what five thousand seven hundred thirty-two times ten is, what's it going to be? It's going to be this number with just one more zero. So it's going to be-- I won't read it out yet.
And then we will think about what 7/8 x would have been equal to. And let's see if y is equal to 7/8 x. So when we get 8 paint balls-- so x is the number of paint balls.
9 plus 5 is 14.
If we divide both of these by 3 this is also a 7 to 5 ratio and if you divide both of these by 7 this is also a 7 to 5 ratio.
So some people remember PEMDAS.
If x is a whole number, what other sets does x belong to? And we saw a couple of videos ago that I mentioned that the notion of the set of whole numbers is a little bit ambiguous. Sometimes whole number means non-negative integers.
Now polls show that men tell twice as many lies as women -- assuming the women they asked told the truth. (Laughing) We deceive to gain advantage and to hide our weaknesses.
Well, what is half of the way to 3/4? Well, we split this section into 2 equal sections.
Twelve minus one is eleven. You have nine x is equal to eleven. Divide both sides by nine, and you get left with x is equal to eleven over nine.
At this point I think you know a little bit about what multiplication is. Or "multi"-plication. What we're going to do in this video is to give you just a ton of more practice, and start you on your memorization of the multiplication tables.
Mapendo, in Swahili, means great love.
Let me label this. This is the hundredth and this is the tenth. When you add or subtract numbers, your answer, so if you just do this, if we just add these two numbers, I get - what?
Because D is equal to D, so I won't be changing the equation.
We're asked to fill in the blanks to complete the equation. So they have 86.93 is equal to 5 tens plus blank ones plus 9 tenths plus 3 hundredths. So let me expand out 86.93 and just think about how I could regroup the value in the different places so that I get something more close or exactly what we have on the right-hand side.
Well, we know that we can interpret this as 23 divided by 6. And if we actually divide 23 by 6-- let's do that. So we divide 6 into 23.
I can give you another definition for acute angle so an acute angle has a measure or it's smaller than a right angle so you learn about radients and degrees which are different ways to measure angles so you'll see that a right angle can be measured as 90 degrees this over here is less than 90 degrees so this is less than 90 degrees. and one way to conceptualize this is that this angle, it's opening is smaller it's more narrow, it's lines are, you would have to rotate one line less to get to the other line then you would over here. here, you would have to move all the way over there here you only have to move it a little bit so the acute angle is less than a right angle so you might imagine already what an obtuse angle is it is greater than a right angle so let me draw a couple of examples of obtuse angles so an obtuse angle might look like
And so you know, twelve grams is like 1/50th of a pound. So that just gives you an idea of how many atoms are laying around at any point in time. This is a huge number.
And you can see that it's pointing to right about--well let's just say to right about the 30 degree mark. So you could say the measure of angle BAC is equal to 30 degrees. And so you could look just straight up from evaluating these numbers that 77 degrees is clearly larger than 30 degrees, and so it is a larger angle which makes sense because it is a more open angle.
So two times nine is eighteen. And thirty over thirty forty-fifth minus eighteen forty-fifths is going to be something over forty-five. Thirty minus eighteen is twelve.
So I'm dividing each pizza into a third, right? How many pieces do I have?
The square root of 4 is 2. And then this we can't simplify anymore. We don't see two numbers multiplied by itself here.
What's going to be the 2/5? 2/5 of her money she is going to invest in the stock market, right?
Let's see, 20 divided by 3.
Part E, the square root of 2000. Same exact process that we've been doing so far. Let's do the prime factorization.
Think about it. Sorry, I'm not ending at a happy note, but I just wanted you all to mull over this. Thank you.
So this is definitely a line. I was able to write it in this form right over here. So can this relationship be represented using a linear equation?
Arrange the digits 2, 6, 0, and 1 so that you create the highest possible four-digit number. So the way I like to think about it is, if I'm trying to create as large of a number as possible,
Then we have -2: (let me do -2 in blue)
9000 - 8000 is 1000. And we're done. And just to make things really clear,
Graph the line that represents a proportional relationship between y and x with a unit rate 0.4.
He's got 3 equal sections, and he's colored, he's colored 2 of them, 2 of them green.
So 9 minutes is 9/60 of an hour. So you could write it this way. It's 9 and 9/60 hours.
We call that word the circumference of the circle. Now, we know how the diameter and the radius relates, but how does the circumference relate to, say, the diameter.
And eight of them are shaded red. So we can say that eight out of nine, are shaded red. Or eight nines or eight over nine.
This is one of the four pieces. The denominator tells us how many pieces.
A squirrel is running across the road at 12 feet/s
Let's do a couple of examples dealing with angles between parallel lines and transversals. So let's say that these two lines are a parallel, so I can a label them as being parallel. That tells us that they will never intersect; that they're sitting in the same plane.
These two statements are completely equivalent. And we know that when you're just adding a bunch of numbers, it doesn't matter what order you do it in, so you can swap the order. So you could say that this is the same thing as 17 plus 5 plus 2/9 plus 1/9.
To be divisible by 6 it has to have at least one 2 and one 3. So it has to have at least one 2 and we already have a 3 over here so that is all we want. We just need one 3.
So let's get all our x's on the left-hand side, and the best way to do that is subtract 8x from both sides. So you subtract 8x from both sides. The left-hand side becomes 5x minus 8x.
You and your friends are making name cards to assign seats for dinner. You each are given an identical strip of blank paper and begin coloring parts of it with crayons. You start with blue, or you start with blue.
Well 59.2 percent - this literally means 59.2 per cent - which literally means 59.2 per 100 - which literally means 59.2 per 100 - which is the same thing as 59.2 ÷ 100.
So 40 divided by 2 is 20. We're going to have that minus sign.
I guess 64 would be a whole, so let's draw a whole here. So let's say that's a whole. Maybe we're talking about a candy bar.
Let's just try to divide 7 into 120.
So b is equal to 1. So this was a lot easier. Here the equation is y is equal to 3x plus 1.
20 goes into 130 -
So let me write that down. 120 is equal to 10 times-- and this is pretty straightforward-- 10 times 12. This is exactly what 120 is.
A ticket to the paint ball arena cost $7, and comes with 8 paint balls. Every extra paint ball costs $1. The equation describes the relationship between the number of paint balls x and their price y.
Well, what if you did something like you divide both sides by negative 7. At this point, what I'm doing is kind of unnecessary.
clockwise
In addition to theorizing on evolution in "The Origin of Species," Charles Darwin also wrote the facial feedback response theory. His theory states that the act of smiling itself actually makes us feel better, rather than smiling being merely a result of feeling good.
left-hand side. So let's add 3 to both sides of this equation. And this'll turn the equation into-- do it in that same pink color --the left-hand side will still be 5 times the absolute value of x plus 3.
It's actually 66.666-- I hope you don't think I'm an evil person because of this number that happened to show up. But anyway, so the highest sale price that I can afford or the highest marked price I can afford is $sixty-six dollars. And if I were to around up, and $0.67 if I were to round to the nearest penny.
6 times 2 is 12, plus 3 is 15.
2 times 9 is 18. Take a zero her because I'm in the tenths place now, I'm really multiplying by 30, that's why my zero is there.
So let's do the x plus five first. Well, just like we did before, we multiply both sides of this equation by x plus five.
What is 10 to the third?
Part D. The inverse of 7, multiplicative inverse, is 1/7. And then finally, let's do E.
Now the last thing we need to do is get it into the standard form. So once again, we just have to algebraically manipulate it so that the x's and the y's are both on this side of the equation. So let's just add 2/3 x to both sides of this equation.
60 percent of children don't go to school, because they have to look after animals -- sheep, goats -- domestic chores. So we thought of starting a school at night for the children. Because the night schools of Tilonia, over 75,000 children have gone through these night schools.
2y=x+7. And we have the second equation over her, that x=y-4. So if we are looking for an x and y that satisfy both constraints, what we can see is, well look, if the x and the y's have to satisfy both restraints, both of these restraints have to be true.
Now, how can we express each of these in terms of the number of texts J.T. sent? Well, they give us some information here. This first statement, J.T. had sent 24 more texts than his older sister.
8 is sitting right over here. So it's a member of the natural numbers, whole numbers, and the integers. Now let's keep expanding things.
It has to be a rhombus. So now were just going to talk about the parallelograms. So what do we know about parallelograms?
And there, in that situation, you say, well, it's the side opposite the 90 degree angle. So if that's the hypotenuse, then this squared plus that squared is going to be equal to 24 squared. So the Pythagorean theorem-- b squared plus 12 squared is equal to 24 squared.
6 is equal to what over 16? Let me think about it.
One in particular, the binomial formula works for your binomial coefficients, which I'm not going to go over right here, when 0 to the zeroth power is equal to 1. So that's an interesting thing for you to think about, what that might even mean. So let's talk about some of the other properties.
Let me mark out the 0 a little bit better, so you see relative to 0. Now we have the absolute value of 8 minus 12. Well, first of all,
So if I were to zoom in on the nucleus during the S phase, if I were to start off-- let me just start with some organism that has two chromosomes. So let's say that at the beginning of S phase, and I'll draw things as chromosomes just to make it clear that things are being replicated.
I just did the distributive property on the 3x and the 2. This is a negative 1 times 3x plus 2. So it's negative 1 times 3x, plus negative 1 times 2.
68 goes into 75 one time.
You get 8y is equal to 10x minus 30, and let's divide both sides by 8. You'll get y is equal to 10/8, is the same thing as 5/4.
12 minus 8 is 4, bring down the zero.
So if you have 12 of something, and you want to take 2/3 of that, you're going to be taking 8 of it. So you're going to be taking 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 or 8 of the fifteenths now. So either way, you get to the same result.
The test for 9 is very similar to the test for 3 If the sum is divisible by 9, then you're there.
It is unbelievably bad. This is, obviously, that famous view now of the Arctic, which is likely to be gone at this point in the next three or four or five years. Very, very, very scary.
I met him at a 46664 event. He was wearing a t-shirt like the one I wear now. This is a tool -- this tells you I am in solidarity with people who have HlV, people who are living with HlV.
And in 1960, all Swedes were saving to try to buy a Volvo like this. This was the economic level at which Sweden was. But in contrast to this, in the developing world, far away, the aspiration of the average family there was to have food for the day.
9 is a perfect square root, so we can stop there. So this second term, we can rewrite it as the square root of 9 times the square root of 3a. And in both of these you can kind of view it I'm skipping an intermediate step.
[Male:] You the man!
So how many times does 8 go into 7?
Let's think about 8. I'll do the same process.
We've got 6798 minus 3359. So let's see how far we can get with the subtraction. So immediately when we're going to the one's place, we're going to subtract a 9 from an 8.
So this is going to be 4 times 1. Let me write it: 4 times 1, minus 2 times 1 to the zeroth power.
5 times 4 is 20. Now we have the same denominator. So this is going to be equal to, our denominator is 48.
What's the best way of communicating in the world today? Television? No.
9 squared times 9 squared times 9 squared. This is 9 squared to the third power. And we also know the other exponent property, or the other exponent rule.
1 times 93 is 93. Becomes a 10. That becomes a 2.
So 4 goes into 29. And it goes, 7, 7, 28. And then we have 10, I didn't have to do that decimal there, oh well.
exams times the 84 average. And this dot is just times. Plus, and there's going to be 2 more exams, right?
What squared equals 33? I don't know. So that doesn't even work.
2 times 1 is 2. We multiply the denominators: 3 times 2 is 6.
Man 7: After this bridge, first exit.
We have eleven / one thousand-- I won't do the division just yet-- grams of drug x per kilogram. This is really just a re-- we've just rewritten this dosage information in different units. And let's see how much solution we need per kilogram.
9 times 1 is 9, plus 2 is 11, you have a remainder of 3. So you get, it's about .69, so 6, so 6.7 point would be a pretty good guess.
We're told this table shows equivalent ratios to 24 to 40.
So that constraint over here. But we have the second constraint as well.
And eight times thirty-two is two hundred forty plus sixteen, it's two hundred fifty-six, right? You could do it that way. And that's reasonable, because it's not that hard to figure out what two to the third is and what two to the fifth is.
Okay, let them shake. You ask the question.
3 minus 2 is 1, 9 minus 5 is 4. So it is 41/24, positive. You can see that here, just by looking at the number line.
3 times 8 is 24. Subtract. You have 4 left over.
Let's see, eight times four, you're going to add eight to it-- thirty-two. Forty.
Gina had 2/3 cup of laundry detergent. She used 1/2 of the detergent on Friday to wash all of her sheets. How much detergent does she have left?
Probably the most obvious way or the easiest way to do it in your head was either just looking at what you have to multiply the numerator by and then doing the same thing to the denominator or maybe by cross multiplication.
4 goes into 10 two times.
Well, 9 is not less than 0. So it's not going to execute this. It's going to go to the else clause.
(Laughter) (Applause) Which African country do you want me to wire all my money to?
So 5 times 24 is also equal to 120, we have two more factors: 5 and 24.
And 16/16 is 1, and you're just left with 3/4.
Forty-nine minus forty is nine, and minus eight is one. We are done. We have evaluated the expression when a is equal to seven and b is equal to negative four.
On the right hand side, the n's cancel out. On the left hand side we have 8/36 * n = 10.
I'll put the 7 right over here below the ones place in 253 and put the multiplication symbol right over here.
We're starting at -3, and to that we're adding -7
Well, 8 does not go into 7. It goes zero times. And actually, just so that we make sure that everything's clean, let's put our decimal.
So it looks like, so the difference between 36 and 49 is.
So over here in 2006 12% preferred Thrill Soda.
Elbert is 220/67 the height of Ben Nevis.
Let's take 8 into 120. Let's just work it out. And just as a little bit of a hint-- well, I'll just work it out.
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. How many of them are in the 2/3 of the 4/5, I should say. And there's 8 of them, 8 of the 15 equals sections.
5 times 5 is 25. Put the 2 up there.
25 does go into 103.
So let me go on the record and say, vulnerability is the birthplace of innovation, creativity and change. (Applause) To create is to make something that has never existed before.
Another way to think about it is if you take the absolute value of a number, it really is just the positive value of that number. So if you took the absolute value of 9 that equals 9.
Well let's just take this step by step. So, I'm gonna write, so let me just go down here, start over.
Let's learn to multiply. M U L T I P L Y. And the best way I think to do anything is just to actually do some examples, and then talk through the examples, and try to figure out what they mean.
7 plus 44 would be 51, so this is going to be 61. So this is going to be equal to 61. And we're done!
Line ST is parallel (two lines) to Line UV. And I think that is the only set of parallel lines in this diagram. Yup.
If we have 1 foot, we're going to have 12 inches, 2 feet, 24 inches.
We know that the mass of X plus the mass of Y is equal to 5. So we could say, one thing we know that X is now is equal to 3. We know that this is now a 3kg mass.
6 plus this thing, that's the same thing as 6 plus x plus negative 5 plus 7. Or you could view this as 6 plus-- So this right here is 2, right? Negative 5 plus 7 is 2, 2 plus 6 is 8, so it becomes 8 plus x.
"Knowing what I know, why am I not a vegetarian?" After all, I'm one of the green guys: I grew up with hippie parents in a log cabin.
One way I like to think about it is parentheses always takes top priority, but then after that, we go in descending order, or I guess we should say in-- well, yeah, in descending order of how fast that computation is. When I say fast, how fast it grows. When I take something to an exponent, when I'm taking something to a power, it grows really fast.
Let me draw something thicker. It doesn't look ideal, but you get the idea. So if we have this angle, let's call it x.
Well, dividing by 10 to the third is the same thing as dividing by 10 three times. And every time you divide by 10, it's going to become a smaller number.
How can express that I can eat less than or equal to 1,500 calories, so I can eat up to and including 1,500 calories? Right now, this is only up to but not including 1,500. How could I express that?
This is equivalent to saying 2/5 times 7/7, which is equivalent to 2/5 times 1, which is equivalent to 2/5. 14/35 is just another way, it's an equivalent representation of 2/5. This is just how much pie only one person should have eaten.
So 1 over negative 2, negative 2 to the third power, to the positive third power. And this is equal to, this is equal to 1 over negative 2, negative 2 times negative 2 times negative 2 times negative 2. Or you could view it as 1 times negative 2 times negative 2 times negative 2, which is going to give you 1 over negative 8 or negative, negative 1 8th.
Let's do some slightly more complicated fractional exponent examples.
And then they pick up the oxygen from inside the alveoli-- or the oxygen diffuses across the membrane of the alveoli, into these capillaries, into these super small tubes. And then once they do, that makes the blood red. I'm going to talk in a little bit about why it becomes red.
(Applause) Now, we put a lot of money into education, and I really think that education is the most important thing to get right for the country to have as strong a future as it should have.
If you divide the 12 by 3, you get a 4.
So eight (8) divided by negative two (-2).
You could also write this as dr is equal to x prime of t dt times the unit vector i. So this was x prime of t dt. This is x prime of t right there times the unit vector i.
In a previous video, we've already seen how we can actually compute this. This is going to be equal to-- in the numerator, we just multiply the numerators. So it's going to be 2 times 4.
what's happening this time why doesn't the talking straight across the table i did it before how you can see it doesn't if we believe in the law of inertia but we must believe that there is an unbalanced force to change the velocity of the pot but this pope is nearly friction locks so what can be exerting this unbalanced correspondent though that you watched the motion this time through a camera which is fixed in the earth's frame of reference
5's cancel out.
Mary's rectangular poster is 36 inches by 20 inches. Susan's rectangular poster is 26 inches by 30 inches. Which poster has a larger area and by how many square inches?
What is two fifths plus one fifth? Well we do the same thing here. We first check to make sure the denominators are the same.
So if I say, two times three, one way to to conceptualize is basic multiplication is really repeating addition, so you could view this as two threes so let me write three plus three and notice there are two of them, there are two of these or you could view this as three twos, and so this is the same thing as two plus two plus two and there are three of them, and either way you can conceptualize as you get the same exact answer. This is going to be equal to six, fair enough! Now, you knew this before you even tried to tackle negative numbers.
Well let's think about this, ten x would just be ten times this so it would be, we can even think of it right over here. it would be, if we multiplied this by ten. We would be moving the decimal one to the right it would be seven point seven seven seven, on and on and on forever. Or we could say it is seven point seven repeating.
Now, the next quantity they want us to figure out is the absolute value of... absolute value of 9 minus 7.
And then, finally, we have -3: that is just 3 to the left of 0.
We can rewrite the 4- since it's in the hundred's place we can write that as 4 times 100
This is our liver, and then when the bile is needed and I'll just write the bile in here in yellow, so you can probably guess what the bile is used to digest. When the bile is needed it's secreted out of the gallbladder and it enters the duodenum, right about here. There's another accessory organ that also sort of dumps it's products into the duodenum, right about there at the same spot.
10/3 is not in the solution set.
What's 4 minus 10? Well, you're going to get a negative number. This is 3 to the negative sixth power.
4 plus 2 is 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. So we get to 102 points. The team in total scored 102 points.
Let's try 0.
(Laughter) "Look away."
Let's do some more percentage problems. Let's say that I start this year in my stock portfolio with $95.00. And I say that my portfolio grows by, let's say, fifteen percent.
3 divided by 3 is just 1.
So this is one piece, two pieces, three pieces of a total of four. So this is going to be equal to 3/4. And hopefully, you see kind of a mathematical way of immediately thinking about it.
So if you have 4x2, divided by 3, times 2, you do 4x2 is 8, divided by 3, times 2 and you say 8 divided by 3 is - well you get a fraction there - it would be 8/3. So this would be 8/3 times 2. And 8/3 times 2 is equal to 16/3.
"happiness" in Chinese literally means "fast joy." Huh! "Bride" in Chinese literally means "new mother." Uh-oh.
So 8 and 1/3 is equal to-- the denominator's going to be 3.
let's list them in order from smallest to largest. So, of all of these values, which is the smallest?
25 goes into 75 three times.
Once again, 9 is 9000/1000, and then plus 700/1000 plus 90/1000-- just multiply the numerator and denominator by 10-- plus 8/1000. And so what is this number on the left? This number on the left is-- how many thousandths is it?
1, 2, 3, 4. So when we squared 6.71, 6.71 is equal to 45.02.
So he could have just said 2/5 times 7/1. 7/1 is the exact same thing as 7. And that would be equal to 2 times 7 in the numerator, which is 14.
And the other one: we could do angle CAH, which is this right over here that plus HAB clearly add up they're adjacent, they form a straight angle so they're clearly adding up to 180 degrees. So they're also supplementary.
And we're all done.
Ok, so there's 3 and 3 but there was also right when you started you had 9 and 1
So 5 is the same thing as 20/4, and then this plus 1/4 is the same thing as plus 1/4. So if I have 20 fourths and I add one more fourth to it, how many fourths do I have?
This is "7" times negative 5.
Every time I see an x here, since f(x) is equal to this, every time I see an x, I would replace it with the input. So f(5) is going to be equal to 49 minus ... instead of writing x^2, I would write 5^2.
But if I had to get a match to match, obviously, I would need a different design of a cellphone. So what we're saying is that scalability should not become an enemy of sustainability. There must be a place in the world for solutions that are only relevant for a locality, and yet, one can be able to fund them.
Anyway, I'll see you in the next video.
So if I take six things and I divide them into groups of three,
So six divided by three is equal to two. So the best way or one way to think about it is that you divided the six into three groups. Now you could view that a slightly different way, although it's not completely different, but it's a good way to think about it.
(Laughter) In America, law is a professional degree: after your university degree, you go on to law school. When I got to law school,
This is 4 times 1 plus 4 times 99. So it's 4 plus 4 times 99 Actually let me write it like this.
Let's see if we can write the fraction "11 over 25" (or we can call it "eleven twenty-fifths") to see if we can write that as a decimal and we're gonna round it to the nearest thousands place.
Or another way of thinking about that is, well, what is 549 divided into groups of 60. This is how many hours we're going to have. So let's do that.
I have a list of numbers here And my goal over the course of this video Is to actually order these numbers.
1-2-3-4-5 And we can go below 0
7 times something is equal to 21. Well, I could think of it two ways.
So let's see, 19 is almost 20. So maybe, let's see if it will go 7 times.
We are not changing the value of the fraction because we are dividing both the numerator and the denominator by the same thing 8 divided by 2 is 4, 10 divided by 2 is 5 and we're done.
In order to find a ray you need that point that you're starting off on so let's that point over there is called X and then you need another point that sits on the ray and the ray is just keep going beyond, we will name that point as "Y" and we will call the ray "XY"
The negative 3 and the plus 3, or the positive 3, cancel out-- that was the whole point-- equals-- what's 18 plus 3?
You multiply the 5 times the 9 and the 4, so you end up with 5 times 9 minus 5 times 4.
I think it goes into it six times.
We garnered much support along the way, and the Hunts Point Riverside Park became the first waterfront park that the South Bronx had had in more than 60 years. We leveraged that $10,000 seed grant more than 300 times, into a $3 million park. And in the fall, I'm going to exchange marriage vows with my beloved.
0.75 times $125.
Now any number other than zero to the zeroth power is going to be 1. So if I tell you x to the zeroth power is equal to what, and I tell you that x is not equal to zero, what is x to the zeroth power? You should immediately know that it is equal to 1.
I have always known but I feel so afraid: even as the explosion happened...
You multiply 20 by 5. So we would do the same thing with the 13.
And we get 4x, the ones cancel out. is greater than 25 minus one is 24. Divide both sides by positive 4 Don't have to do anything to the inequality since it's a positive number.
So let's say five goes into twenty-three-- well, five goes into twenty-three four times.
So it's going to be 147 minus 96 is going to be 51, 51 over 2 is equal to 49 plus 2 is 51 over 2. so it all checks out.
So we get threey is equal to, what is that, twelve, right? So y is equal to four. So our algebra has told us that in four years Salman is going to be exactly four times as old as Jonathan.
We have a really interesting question from Denmark. Flemming asks, how does Google view font replacement?
I am most excited about the dash board and instantly back that I get that my students get to show where they are not understanding certain things both for themselves and for me so that I can help them and they can recognize their areas that they need to improve and I think Khan has done a great job in making it a very user friendly dash board.
That's in the one's place 8 times 1, or we just write plus 8 Now we can distribute this 4
Now let's see, 4 goes into 60 15 times and then to go from 60 to 70 you have to go another 10, so it's not divisible by four.
And there are many more differences between A and B than there are between two influenza A viruses. So I'm focusing right now on influenza A and B viruses because these are the types that cause sickness and epidemics every winter in the United States.
(Laughter) I just couldn't believe how many things you can get here."
6 -- 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, and so on. And these arrows mean that the numbers keep going in both directions. I know this is a little early for you to learn this.
This one has 4 times 9x plus 4. Well, no, we have negative 4x plus 9, this is different in multiple ways, and they're multiplying it by 4 instead of negative 9.
0 plus 9 is 9.
Let's see if we can simplify 5 times the square root of 117. So 117 doesn't jump out at me as some type of a perfect square.
I think what is probably the most misunderstood concept in all of science and, as we all know, is now turning into one of the most contentious concepts - may be not in science, but in our popular culture - is the idea of evolution. Evolution. And whenever we hear this word - I mean: even if we don't hear in in the biological context -, we imagine that something is changing, it is evolving, and so when people use the word evolution in its everyday context, they think of this notion of change that, you know, - this is going to test my drawing ability - , but they, you know:
(Laughter) I found a tractor fan, shock absorber, PVC pipes. Using a bicycle frame and an old bicycle dynamo,
1970, the U.S. and most of Europe have gotten rid of it.
Some areas where people'd been living became inhospitable, and in some other places, new barriers of ice or desert separated groups of people, but against all odds, some people found ways to survive in severe conditions as far north as Siberia.
CA: What are your plans? MlT?
This was another hero generation that brought democracy to the planet. Another that ended slavery. And that gave women the right to vote.
And of course, you have all the stuff on either side-- the divide 4-- no. Oops. That's not what I want.
Chris Anderson: For so many people at TED, there is deep pain that basically a design issue on a voting form -- one bad design issue meant that your voice wasn't being heard like that in the last eight years in a position where you could make these things come true.
So 48/64 is the same thing as 24/32, which is the same thing as 6/8. And these are both divisible by 2, so if you divide the numerator by 2, you get 3. You divide that the denominator by 2, you get 4.
These cancel out. And then the equation becomes y is equal to x minus 4/9. Where is the slope?
18 minus 9 is 9, 8 minus 5 is 3, 7 minus 3 is 4, 6 minus 3 is 3. Three thousand four hundred and thirty nine.
And then what is the slope? m is equal to change in y over change in x. Let's start at that y-intercept. If we go over to the right by one, two, three, four.
If we say what 2 squared is, well, based on this definition, we start with a 1, and we multiply it by 2 two times.
So, for example, you could say something like x + 3 = 1. And in this situation where you have one equation, with only one unknown, you could actually figure out what x needs to be in this scenario. And you could possibly even do it in your head.
Let's do two times negative three, I want to make the negative into a different color. Two times negative three. Well, one way you could view this is the same analogy here, it's negative three twice so it would be negative..
It's not a 0, that's an o for older sister. And they also tell us that J.T. sent 50 fewer texts than his younger sister, so j is also equal to the younger sister minus 50, right? 50 fewer texts than his younger sister.
Welcome to the presentation on dividing fractions. Let's get started. So before I give you the intuition-- actually, I might do that in a different module-- I'm just going to show you the mechanics of how you divide a fraction.
500 years ago, trans-oceanic travel became a reality.
So 4 + 8 is equal to 12, and 12 clearly is divisible by 3.
Regroup the 1. We can ignore that. That was from before.
And then all of a sudden he said, "Well, that's all cute what you did Sal. I understand what you said." There's some number of sessions where 12s is equal to 20 plus 8s, where we get the same exact cost.
So we need to figure out what 46 plus 43 is. Let me write it down again and I'll write it like this: 46 plus 43.
I got infected when I was 17, when, as a student of the design college, I encountered adults who actually believed in my ideas, challenged me and had lots of cups of chai with me. And I was struck by just how wonderful it felt, and how contagious that feeling was.
0.5 is just going to be equal to 0.5. Now 13/93. To convert a fraction into a decimal we just take the denominator and divide it into the numerator.
So far, out of the two digits, the two places we've looked at, this one on the right is 9 plus 7/10. So this immediately cues to me that the one on the left is the larger number. You're like, hey, how do I know immediately that's the larger number?
So I'm first going to add 1/2, which is the same thing as 4/8.
So if we do this first, we get the three times five, which is fifteen, and then we add the seven. The addition or subtraction - I'll do it here we just have addition - just like that. So we do the multiplication first, get 15, then add the 7 ... 22
So right now, it's expressed in terms of, we've solved for
The distance is 100 meters. And its equal to, we don't know the rate, so I'll just write rate right over here. Its, and I'm going to write in that same color.
y is directly proportional to x.
So this angle-- do it in this screen --this angle right here has to be 60 degrees. Now this angle corresponds to that angle, but they're not equal. The corresponding angles are not equal, so these
0 minus 0 is 0.
4 parts out of 4 total parts equals 1 whole. But this also makes sense from what we know of division. This little fraction symbol that we keep using, this is the same thing as divided by.
If we do a prime factorization of 8, you get 2 times 4. 4 is 2 times 2. So 8 is 2 times 2 times 2.
So let's actually construct what 9.15 hours looks like. So let me draw a little line here, and on the top I'll label Hours, and on the bottom I'll label Minutes.
let's think about what -9 looks like or where it is in the number line and where -7 is on the number line. Let's see where the absolute values mean and then we should probably be able to do this comparison. So there are a couple ways to think about it.
Earth's geographic south, we'll call that the south pole.
No 0's in it, right?
If i plan to attend more that 5 sessions a month the basic plan is going to be cheaper. If i plan to attend exactly 5 sessions a month it doesn't matter which plan i acutally use
Let's do sixty-four thousand three hundred twenty-nine times-- let me think of a nice number. Times four. I'm going to show you right now that we're going to do the exact same process that we did in the last video.
Now, what is 12 times x plus y plus z? Well, we don't know yet exactly what x+y+z is equal to, but this first equation might help us. This first equation, we can rewrite this left-hand side by factoring out the 3.
If Y is 4 maybe X is 1 or maybe X is 4, Y is 1. Who knows what these are. The interesting thing is we can actually use both of these information to figure out what X and Y actually is.
Let's see, 5 does not go into 48. 7 does not go into 48. It looks like we're all done.
Anyway, I'll take Earth out of the equation because it gets a little bit confusing. And we'll just stick to bars because that tends to be a
You can divide the 3 by 3 and get a 1. So you get 2 times 4 is equal to 8 over 1 times 5, which is 5. So x is equal to 8/5.
They didn't talk about vulnerability being comfortable, nor did they really talk about it being excruciating -- as I had heard it earlier in the shame interviewing. They just talked about it being necessary. They talked about the willingness to say, "I love you" first ... the willingness to do something where there are no guarantees ... the willingness to breathe through waiting for the doctor to call after your mammogram.
What's happening to the climate?
Well 141 - (And it's a little bit more mental computation than you might be used to.) But 141 - 9 is going to be 132. So we are left with 132. Let's do this one.
So, it's negative 7x, so we add 7x so that's why. And we do that, become the right side, these two will cancel.
0.5 is 0.5.
40 is 2 times 20, which is 2 times 10, which is 2 times 5. So 40 is 2 times 2 times 2 times 2 times 2 times 5. This is the prime factorization of 40.
5 to the zeroth power is just going to be equal to 1. So this experssion becomes 4 times 5, minus 2 times 1, or 4 times 5 is 20, minus 2 times 1, that is 2. And this is equal to 18.
A statistician for a basketball team tracked the number of points that each of the twelve players on the team had in one game and then made a STEM and LEAF plot to show the data, and sometimes it's called a stem plot. How many points did the team score, and when you first look at this plot right over here, it seems a little hard to understand. Under stem, you have 0, 1, 2.
6w divided by 6 is just w and then 60 divided by 6 is 10. So, we have w=10. So this, the width of the garden is 10.
Now, you're saying, hey, Sal, 100 billion new cells a day? That must mean like every cell in my body has created, well that just gives you an idea of how many cells we have. We actually have on the order of, and you know it's obviously not an exact number, but actually in the human body, there's on the order of 100 trillion cells.
Lothar Meggendorfer put his foot down, and he said, "Genug ist genug!" He grabbed his pen, he snatched his scissors. This man refused to fold to the conventions of normalcy and just decided to fold.
Well, 1 liter is 100 centiliters. Centiliter is 1/100 of a liter. Notice, this and this are the inverse statements.
I've gotten feedback that all the Chuck Noris imagery in the last video might have been a little bit too overwhelming. So, for this video, I've included something a little bit more soothing. So let's try to simplify some more expressions. and we'll see we're just applying ideas that we already knew about.
In this video I want to talk about how we can convert repeating decimals into fractions. So let's give ourselves a repeating decimal.
So 4 times 200 is 800. So, what we were essentially doing by writing in the right places, we were saying:
like this, 2 x 9 = ? x 3 or we get 18 = ? x 3 so the number of cups of flour we need to use times 3 needs to be 18.
But I just wanted to show you that what we're doing in this module is nothing new than what we've always been doing when we divide by a number.
- so it would evaluate to -2. (That's what we're going to substitute for x now, in this context.) - and y is now 3 -
We need to add 7.056 to 605.7 to 5.67. Now when you're adding any number, you always want to make sure you line up numbers in the same place. And especially when you're dealing with decimals, the easiest way to do that is to just line up the decimals.
4y is greater than negative 48 minus 8, so we're gonna go another 8 negative.
So 2/3 and 4/6 are the same thing. So Micah has colored in the same amount that I have. Now let's see whether any of these other fractions are the same.
1.2 liters of I guess the other stuff in there is water.
Somehow, the family survives for 16 months, and then, by extraordinary luck, and the passionate heart of a young American man, Sasha Chanoff, who manages to put her in a U.S. rescue plane, Rose Mapendo and her nine children end up in Phoenix, Arizona, where they're now living and thriving.
Now I'm left with 268 and we say, how many times does 16 go into 268. Let's see, 800 is too big, even 320 is now too big. Well, we could say, let's see 10 times 16 results in 160.
Because we went from five sections to twenty.
This is the Earth, as it looked 90 million years ago. Geologists call this period the 'Late Cretaceous'.
If I keep saying zero, you might find that annoying. five hundred The next number -- right here, there's a decimal right there. The next number I'm going to do is the number seven hundred and twenty-three. The next number I'll do -- I'm having a lot of seven's here.
(Audience: Aloha.) Today I'm going to try to convince you that what the world needs now is ukulele.
5 is a prime number, so we'll put 5 right there. And then, 12 is the same thing as 26, and 6 = 23. So, in our LCM, we have to have two 2's, but we already have two 2's, and we already have one 3.
But even if we didn't have the number line, we could say "Look, we're already 3 below zero... We're going to go another 7 to the left... another 7 more negative."
And Jonathan's going to be twenty-four plus y years old. And now we just solve the equation.
But if you just think about it in your mind, it should also make sense. If there are 2,000 pounds per ton and there are 1 and 1/2 tons, I should multiply 1 and 1/2 times 2,000 to get the number of pounds. That makes sense.
I came to the U.S. in 1995, so which books did I read here first? Books banned in China, of course.
And then we get, negative twenty-one divided by three is negative seven, is less than or equal to x, which is less than or equal to fifteen divided by three is five.
You'd add the 1.901 plus the 2.09.
We have 400 million cellphones in this country. Now, it is possible that I use only two buttons on the cellphone, only three options on the cellphone.
But you could stop watching this, if you find this part confusing. So let's rewrite our proportion.
Hank: Hi, I'm Hank, and I'm a human. Let's pretend for a moment that I'm a moth.
"You either say this," and then he covered up the word,
(Applause) I could not get rid of them.
Z,X, and Y are co-linear. And what we have over here, this is a 180 degree angle, or we should say the measure of angle ZXY is 180 degrees. And you can actually go beyond that.
So let me think about what six-ninths minus two-fifths are.
That's negative 6 over there. Now let's think about z being less than 4 Z being less than 4, we put a circle around 4, since we're not including 4 and it'd be everything, everything less than 4.
3 plus 11 is 14 plus 4 is 18, so that part right there is just 18. This will be a little bit trickier, because we know that when we add fractions, we have to have the same denominator. And now we have to make all three of these characters have the same denominator and that denominator has to be the
6 is definitely 5 or larger, so we want to round up.
And this is going to be equal to 30 plus 10, which does, indeed, equal a total of 40 square feet. So this first one does satisfy this equation right over here. Now let's look at the second one, 6 large tiles and 6 small tiles.
In countries where girls don't go to school and you offer a meal to girls in school, we see enrollment rates about 50 percent girls and boys. We see a transformation in attendance by girls. And there was no argument, because it's incentive.
1 times 3 is 3.
If you have clothes, and you don't have enough time to wash them, he brought a washing machine to your doorstep, mounted on a two-wheeler. So here's a model where a two-wheeler washing machine ... He is washing your clothes and drying them at your doorstep.
We're asked to solve for x. Let me just rewrite this equation so that the absolute values really pop out.
both sides. The left-hand side becomes minus 3x minus 3 is equal to, these two Xs cancel out, is equal to 8.
And we've already seen, or we've seen many, many videos ago, that 6/6, just like 7/7, these are each equal to a whole. These are each equal to 1. And we can now view this as 6 divided by 6, which is the same thing as 1.
So this piece of information up here-- let me underline it. Nazrith is 4 years older Omama. Well, that piece of information tells us that Omama today, if
They are kind of if one is going horizontal then the other one will be going vertical. so let me draw with rays first so the right angle this one is going from the left to the right and the other ray is going from the bottom to the top this angle right over here is a right angle and I could label it like that but as a traditional angle but the general, the general convention for labeling right angles is to put a little, a kind of a half of a box over there.
7 over 27 times 9 over 14. We can do the same trick we did over here. Divide the numerator and the denominator by 7, so this becomes a 1, this becomes a 2.
15 times 2 is 30 and 6 times 5 is 30. So this is definitely a common multiple and it is the smallest of all of their LCMs.
So, if we think of in, in, in terms of constants of proportionality, and direct variation, we could say that the distance, we could say that the distance is equal to some constant, times the time, times the time that it travels. The distance varies directly with the amount of time that travels for this particular object. If an asteroid travels 3000 miles, in, if the asteroid travels 3000 miles in 6 hours, what is the constant of variation?
My heart is trembling.
Let's say I go to a store and I have fifty dollars in my pocket. fifty dollars in my wallet.
It does that on this line right here, prints 1, and then it prints the type of this whole thing right over here. So instead of printing itself, it prints its type. And its type is a String.
That's equivalent to 3 times 13. And then all of these are now prime numbers.
You're going to keep getting thirty-three-- the three's are just going to go on forever. So it turns out that three is nine percent of-- you can either write it as 33.3 repeating or we all know that 0.3 forever is the same thing as one / three.
you can also print one of these too.
on Saturday william's parents gave birth to twins and names them nadia and vanessa when they were first born. Nadia weighed 7.27 pounds and was 21.5 inches tall.
Negative 8 kilometers. The Diamantina trench at negative 8 kilometers is the deeper point. This is fun, because in some of these questions you actually learn things.
Now they tell us if y = 30 when x = 6 so y is 30 when x is 6 [writes 30 = &lt;space&gt; 6]
And then this last term will just become a negative 4 over 9. Actually, let me write this out here.
Food, if you come to the Barefoot College, is solar cooked. But the people who fabricated that solar cooker are women, illiterate women, who actually fabricate the most sophisticated solar cooker. It's a parabolic Scheffler solar cooker.
[Sal] Exactly, 2 rows of 8 works So we can say 2 and 8 are factors.
And let's add all of these up. Now we'll start in the hundredths place. There's nothing here, so 9 plus nothing plus 1 is 10, plus 5 is 15.
Notice, we distributed the 5. We multiplied it times both the 9 and the 4. In the first distributive property video, we gave you an idea of why you have to distribute the 5, why it makes sense, why you don't just multiply it by the 9.
So the way we've expressed it right now, it isn't is an improper fraction, but they want us to write it as a simplified mixed number, so let's do that. So how many times does 12 go into 95?
So they say it is 1 and 1/2 tons. And it's always easier to deal with improper fractions than mixed numbers, so let's write this as an improper fraction. 1 and 1/2 tons is the same thing as-- well, 1 ton is 2 halves, and then you add another 1 half, that's 3 halves.
But now I can distribute, I can say that, well, this over here is the same as two times one which is two plus two times nine-hundred and ninety-nine.
8.23 times 10 to the 10. I think you get the idea now. It's pretty straightforward.
So I came home from work one night, and I logged onto the computer, and I started up a tiny website called 1000awesomethings.com. I was trying to remind myself of the simple, universal, little pleasures that we all love, but we just don't talk about enough -- things like waiters and waitresses who bring you free refills without asking, being the first table to get called up to the dinner buffet at a wedding, wearing warm underwear from just out of the dryer, or when cashiers open up a new check-out lane at the grocery store and you get to be first in line -- even if you were last at the other line, swoop right in there.
They'll just be blanks: 1, 2, and 3. 3 chairs, and I have 7 people.
Demitry, a little bit more poker won't kill you. A little bit? We're playing for one or two hours!
7 divided by 8 or 7/8 is equal to 7 divided by 8, which is equal to 0.875. But I'll put a leading 0 here just so it makes it clear that this is where the decimal is. 0.875.
Well F equals ma. Or, acceleration is equal to force divided by you mass.
And that thing, the difference between w a 150, that absolute distance, has to be less than 2 and 1/2. Now, we've seen examples of solving this before. This means that this thing has to be either, or it has to be both, less than 2 and 1/2 and greater than negative 2 and 1/2.
Once again we got n=45. Now the last way I am going to show you involves a little bit of algebra.
So, let's see what 35 times 8 is.
We're asked to solve for x and we have this compound inequality here.
Well, if we look at just inside of it, the first thing we want to do is simplify the parentheses inside the parentheses.
XY And Z are on the same they're all lined on the same line If you would imagine that a line could keep going on and on forever and ever; So we can say that XY and Z are collinear
Shutter lag is the time between your pressing the shutter button and the moment the camera actually snaps. It's extremely frustrating on any camera under $1,000.
Well, 40 is lower than 80, so we say 40 is the least common multiple. That's what I call the brute force method.
12 divided by 0.6 is 20. And we can verify. Let's verify this.
Now I'm dividing the space between 0 and 1 into 4 equal spaces.
15 over 11, 15/11 minus 9/7. Let's get a common denominator. Let's see, between 11 and 7, I think 77 is going to be the first number you're going to find that is divisible by both.
So let's do some fraction division problems. What is 2/3 divided by 5/6?
So let's think about that.
How many scored between 10 and 19 points, and then how many scored 20 points or over, and you see the distribution right over here. But let's actually answer the question that they're asking us to answer -- how many points did the TEAM score? So here, we just have to add up all of these numbers, right over here.
And, they're also going to be the same to these other characters, down here, because these are congruent triangles. Now, if we take an altitude...
3*45 = 135. So, 3/4 equals 135/180. Now let's do 4/5.
(Music) One of my favorite magicians is Karl Germain. He had this wonderful trick where a rosebush would bloom right in front of your eyes.
If it helps, we can rewrite this as 0.25 (which is the same thing as 25%) 0.25 times some number is equal to 150.
3, I'll put it in parentheses like that. Well, one point that I want to point out is that I did not have to swap the inequality sign, because I multiplied both sides by a positive number.
I'd like to take you to another world. And I'd like to share a 45 year-old love story with the poor, living on less than one dollar a day.
So 6 is what times 1? Well it's just 6.
So, imagine you're standing on a street anywhere in America and a Japanese man comes up to you and says, "Excuse me, what is the name of this block?" And you say, "I'm sorry, well, this is Oak Street, that's Elm Street.
We have the equation -16= (x/4) + 2 and we need to solve for X. So we really just need to isolate the X variable on one side of this equation; and the best way to do that is first to isolate it -- isolate this whole X/4 term from all the other terms. So in order to do that, let's get rid of this 2; and the best way to get rid of that 2 is to subtract it.
And now, this left-hand side just becomes an x, because these guys cancel out. x is greater than 8 times 15 is 80 plus 40 is 120, so negative 120. Is that right?
So 3 plus 8 is 11. The 1 in the ones place, and the 1 in the tens place. 10 plus 1 is 11.
Now, 4 is not prime, because this is divisible by 1, 2 and 4. We could keep going.
21s is equal to 3. Like we said, we could do this two ways, which are essentially the same way.
And two times two to the eighth, well that's the same thing as two to the first times two to the eighth.
So it's four plus twelve forty-fifths, or if we want it to write it as a mixed number, this is equal to four and twelve fourty-fifths. We can simplify this further: twelve and forty-five have common factors.
Let's do the multiples of 10. They are 10, 20, 30, 40... well, we already went far enough. Because we already got to 30, and 30 is a common multiple of 15 and 6 and it is the smallest common multiple of all of them.
Alyssa when you heard that, you know the Khan Academy, you're gonna take a meeting with them, Were you expecting that you were gonna walk away thinking, "Wow, this is maybe something I'd like to do"? Ah, to be honest I really didn't know what to think going in.
This is the same thing is 4 thousands, 3 hundreds, 5 tens and then 6 ones. So when they ask what is the place value of 3 into 4,356, we're concerned with this 3 right here, and it's place value.
You get to 56-- still not quite there. Add another 14.
But in 2007, my path crossed again with the Indus script. That's when I was in India, and I had the wonderful opportunity to meet with some Indian scientists who were using computer models to try to analyze the script. And so it was then that I realized there was an opportunity for me to collaborate with these scientists, and so I jumped at that opportunity.
The correct answer is 14/5 or 2 and 4/5. So explanation A seems to be the right one, but we'll just read the other ones just to see if there's some flaws in them. Explanation B, Ken multiplied correctly but forgot to cancel out the 7's in the fractions.
Okay, it's great to be back at TED. Why don't I just start by firing away with the video?
So the numerator, negative seven (-7) times three (3), positive seven (7) times three (3) would be twenty-one (21), but since exactly one of these two are negative, this is going to be negative twenty-one (-21), that's gonna be negative twenty-one (-21) over negative one (-1).
What's the fourth term?
Contagious is a good word.
Negative 21/19. And if you were to multiply these two numbers, you would get 1. The negatives would cancel out.
This is 2 and 4/5. x is less than 2 and 4/5. I just wrote this improper fraction as a mixed number. Now let's do the other constraint over here in magenta.
We know that new plate material is being formed and these lithospheric plates on the surface of the earth are moving around, and that might raise the question in your brain, "What happens if we kind of reverse things? We know the direction that they're moving in; what does that tell us about where they came from?"
Let's do a few more examples where we're evaluating expressions with unknown variables. So in this first one, we're told that 3x plus 3y plus 3z is equal to 1, and then we're asked, "What is 12x plus 12y plus 12z equal to?" And I'll give you a few moments to think about that.
We've already seen that if we take a whole, and in this example, the whole is this entire green circle.
Let's see, what's eight hundred and fifty minus eighty-five. It'll be thirty-five less than eight hundred.
So 14 minus 7 is 7. 10 minus 8 is 2 Now 270,952.
Well if we look at these two pictures, we can see that I've eaten the same amount of the pie.
And so for every block that you have in Model A, for every block here, you must have four in Model B.
Let's make it 2 and 1/4. So let's first think about the whole number part, the 2.
The triangles below are similar. Find the missing length in triangle BEG. So, the missing length is right here.
So if it took him-- he left t minutes before 6 o'clock and got there, so when does he get back? Well, it's going to take him t minutes to get back, so he's going to arrive at 6 o'clock plus t. And so what was the total amount of time that he traveled?
Later when this material was translated into a common European language, which is to say Latin, they simply replaced the Greek Kai with the Latin X. And once that happened, once this material was in Latin, it formed the basis for mathematics textbooks for almost 600 years. But now we have the answer to our question.
Well, 60 minutes is a whole hour.
Their break even is $25 right around there. Let me draw the line a little bit better than that. The line is going to look like this.
Now we can solve it. We could say, x, which is 40 degrees, plus y plus y is equal to 180.
You get 7 plus 4 which is 11, and then you have another 7 plus 4. You have 11 plus 11, so you have 22 centimeters.
To get started, visit your Video Manager page, find a captioned video, click the drop-down menu by the Edit button, and select "Captions".
95% of the oil effluence are removed in the first attempt itself. Now to our final ingredient, saw dust.
Let's think about how or what 1/2 times 5 represents.
And the last was they had connection, and -- this was the hard part -- as a result of authenticity, they were willing to let go of who they thought they should be in order to be who they were, which you have to absolutely do that for connection.
To get that x plus one out of the denominator, we multiply both sides of this equation times x plus one over one times this side. Since we did it on the left-hand side we also have to do it on the right-hand side, and this is just seven / one, times x plus one over one. On the left-hand side, the x plus one's cancel out.
Or 4 times 100, that's the same thing as 4 times 1 plus 99 That's all this 4 is 400, which is the same thing as 4 times 100 which is the same thing as 4 times 1 plus 99
8 times 35 is exactly 280, and we don't have any remainder now, so we don't have to bring down any more of these zeroes. So now we know exactly that 63 divided by 35 is equal to exactly 1.8.
72 times 10 is 720.
Well, once again, 16 divided by 8 is 2, but the signs are different.
And we're going to be talking about 600, 700 people."
Well, 4 divided by 2, I have two groups of two, so that is equal to 2. Now, what if I took those same four objects: one, two, three, four.
When you add a 40 plus a 40, you get an 80. So you get 80 plus 9, which is 89. And the whole reason why I did this is
One Taiwanese production studio would interpret American politics in 3D.
So 6.7, 6.7 times 6 point, maybe I'll write the multiplication symbol there.
5 × 30 = 150. Subtract, you get 0.
So we really just have to think about two points that satisfy this equation here. The most obvious one is what happens when x equals zero.
And then we can say that 10 is the same thing as 2 times 5. Both two and 5 are prime, so we are done factoring it. So the LCM of 15, 6 and 10, just needs to have all of these prime factors.
What is minus 54 divided by minus 6?
"How certain are you?" They wanted to answer that "99 percent." The Chinese objected, and so the compromise was
hi you lose people want to really up that that you better come into my frame of reference now
Even in the times of H1N1, I like the word. Laughter is contagious. Passion is contagious.
So you distribute the negative sign: subtracting at three and then you're subtracting the two-fifths. And so now we can worry about the whole number parts: seven minus three.
Let's just do part c here. 3/4 times 1/3. We could do that exact same principle.
In this video we are gonna talk a little bit about order of operations. And I want you to pay close attention because, really, EVERYTHlNG else that you are gonna do in mathematics is going to be based on your having a solid grounding in Order of Operations. So, what are we even talk...mean, when we say Order of Operations?
And look at Ragav, that moment when his face changes because he's been able to understand that he has shifted that man's mindset. And that can't happen in a classroom.
So we're trying to solve for x. How old is Nazrith today. So let's just say Naz today that is equal to x.
What I want to do in this video is think about the idea of fraction. And for the sake of this video, as we learn what a fraction is, you can think of it as a part of a whole. Later on we will think of it in even more ways.
And the horizontal component of our velocity is going to be
Does it make sense that 51 decimeters are equal to 5 meters? Well, sure. It should go down.
You might we wondering cross multiplication does not make sense. If you have setup a proportion like this, why should cross multiplication work. That comes from algebra.
But if we subtract minus six from both sides, on the left-hand side we're just left with minus fivex equals, and on the right-hand side we have thirty-four. Now it's a level one problem. We just multiply both sides times negative one / five.
So you divide 549 into groups of 60.
And that you have another angle, so so let me put some letters here again, and I'll start re-using letters, so this is 'A', 'B', 'C', and you have another angle that looks like this, that looks like this, I already used 'C', that looks like this notice and let's say once again that this is 50 degrees, and this right over here is 130 degrees, clearly angle DBA plus angle ABC, if you add them together, you get 180 degrees.
So they have 76,830 is equal to 6 ten thousands plus blank thousands plus 8 hundreds plus 3 tens.
20,000 years ago, the world suffered in the depths of the last ice age.
The other way is you could actually go straight from this equation. So we get 720 is 160 plus 160 (320) and width (w) plus width (w) or 2 times the width (2w). Anything plus itself is just 2 times that anything.
Flash-forward to the next year and "The Book of Awesome" has now been number one on the bestseller list for 20 straight weeks.
A single postage stamp costs $0.44. How much would a roll of 1000 stamps cost? And there is really a couple of ways to do it, and I'll do it both ways just to show you they both work.
Thirty-six times twenty is equal to seven hundred twenty. And hopefully that should explain why we had to throw this zero here. If we didn't throw that zero here we would have just a two-- we would just have a seventy-two here, instead of seven hundred twenty.
So it turns out that if your portfolio grew by twenty-five percent and you ended up with $100.00 you started with $80.00. And that makes sense, because twenty-five percent is roughly one / four, right? So if I started with $80.00 and I grow by 1/4, that means I grew by $twenty, because twenty-five percent of eighty is twenty.
But people lie every day. (Ringing) Hold on.
So 8/8-- so that's 1/8, 2/8, 3/8, 4/8, 5/8, 6/8, 7/8, and 8/8, and it's a whole. So I have a whole whole here, so that's 8/8.
He went 27.5 miles in 0.5. So if you divide something by 0.5, this is the same thing as 27.5 times 2. Let me do it this way, times 2.
16 fluid ounces plus 3 pints plus 4 quarts is equal to how many gallons?
2 goes into 12 six times.
So let's add 9 to it, so that's this first sentence.
You're just walking down the street and someone comes up to you and says "Quick!
1,000 times 10 is 10,000.
First you have to have it.
This is the two in twenty-seven. This is really a twenty and this is really a forty. So twenty times forty is equal to just eight with two zeros.
And we're going to have today.
When I gave up sugar for 30 days, day 31 looked like this. (Laughter) So here's my question to you:
Which is equal to, we can do this in our head, 268. So that's what the first expression is.
0.75. That cancels out, so on the right-hand side, I'm left with just an m.
I want you to be simply selfish.
I've always had a fascination for computers and technology, and I made a few apps for the iPhone, iPod Touch, and iPad. I'd like to share a couple with you today. My first app was a unique fortune teller called Earth Fortune that would display different colors of earth depending on what your fortune was.
So let's subtract minus 2.35 from both sides. These will cancel out. That was the point.
1 tenth plus 2 tentsh plus 3 tenths is 6 tenths. we got our decimal sign right over there. and then 7 plus eight is fifteen. or you could even say it is 5 ones and one ten. and we're done they weighed 15.61 pounds in total
Three times negative seven is negative twenty-one plus five is negative sixteen.
When you want to highlight -- this is just an example -- (Laughter) When you want to highlight a word, please don't waste your life dragging across it with the mouse like a newbie. Double click the word.
And then we are going to keep going as we keep dividing but we see that this value is already greater than the 1.081, so if we really need to order these numbers
So we don't have the tools yet, and this is what's exciting about calculus, we will soon have the tools to figure out what is the rate of change of y with respect to x at exactly this point? But we don't have that tool yet, but using just the tools from algebra, we can at least start to think about what is the average rate of change over the interval from x one to x two? Well, what's the average rate of change?
(Laughter) Al Gore spoke at the TED conference I spoke at four years ago and talked about the climate crisis. And I referenced that at the end of my last talk.
[Sal] and you get to 9 [Ben] So 3 is a factor
I think that's right, assuming that I didn't make any careless mistakes. Let's do another problem.
We get minus 1/2 x is equal to 1/12. I hope I did not make a mistake. If that step confuse you -- I went a little fast -- you might just want to review the addition and subtraction of fraction.
So the greatest common factor of 10 and 7, or the greatest common divisor, is going to be equal to 1 So let's write that down: 1
What I want to do in this video is think about exponents in a slightly different way that will be useful for different contexts and also go through a lot more examples. So in the last video, we saw that taking something to an exponent means multiplying that number that many times.
So if you're further away than E, you should be cool. And it's strictly greater than because if you're at E, that's the largest distance that you would still be pulled inside. Very good.
What's -3 nimus 3? Well now we're going to get 3 less than -3 well that's -6
It's less than. So we tried something that is in our solution set and it did work. And something that is not, and it didn't work.
93 goes into 13? Well, we know it goes into 13 zero times. Right?
So we first try to find just the smallest prime number that will go into 75. Now, the smallest prime number is 2.
78 is exactly 15% of 520.
Anyway, enough about Magnesia. Back to the magnets. So if this is a magnet, and let me draw another magnet.
Now, what do we know about how old he will be in 40 years? Well, he's going to bee how old he is now plus 40. I'll right that down.
Well now, we're constraining x to be - x would have to be - x would have to be equal to 0. (x = 0) But the important point here - 1) hopefully, you realize the difference between an expression and an equation.
25 does go into 110.
20 minus 14 is 6. That's what the left-hand side simplifies to. The right-hand side, we have 6 times 2, which is 12 minus 6.
-- there are 12 blocks left over after removing those first two -- so, 1/3 of 12: we are only going to have four of these little 1kg boxes left.
welcome to level one linear equations let's start doing some problems so let's say i had the equation 5 (that's a big fat 5).
So 15 is greater than or equal to 8, so we are dealing with an improper fraction.
And then we have to get close to 9,052 Once again, that 873- those digits look pretty good 873- we still want to multiply 3, and then 10 So this is going to be times 30 right over here
All right, now let's solve each of these independently. To get rid of the fractions, the easiest thing to do is to multiply both sides of this equation by 4. That'll eliminate all of the fractions, so let's do that.
20/4 or 20 pieces, where each piece is 1/4. Now, the 1/4 right here represents literally one more fourth of a pie or one more piece of a pie, so let me draw another pie here. So that is another pie.
We added 0.1x ounces of saline, so if we add these two numbers, it should also be equal to the total amount of saline. So this has to be equal to the sum of these two things. It has to be equal to 12.5 plus 0.1x.
Do you have to look at the paper? Yeah. Come on dude.
2 times 2 is 4.
It was nothing; they don't know what love is.
"What do you do?" "I study shame." "Oh." (Laughter) And I see you.
That tells me that this is a right angle or, that if this is going left to right this is going perfectly top to bottom that this is a no way kind of that this is a completely,
You need 2 more to get to 9. So you're going to have 2 left over, so this is 1 and 2/7. And we're done!
So you will get electricity for the life time FREE.
lets classify what we have 1/3 is not a natural number as it is not a counting number.
And said "This is a bigger opening. What is the relationship here?" Or they might have looked at a tree that had a branch that came off like that.
So if we have the minutes they play time playing Bologna and the time playing Cut Your Wire. If I were to add those two together, so if I say x plus y. I'll write that plus in a neutral color, x plus y.
So 2 minus negative 3 is the exact same thing as 2 plus positive 3. These two statements are equivalent, and this just boils down to, this right over here is just going to be 5. Now, let's mix it up a little bit more.
So let's just think about 76,830.
See you in the next video.
And so, let's just say-- you know, I'm not measuring these exactly-- let's say that this is 30 degrees. We know that if we go all the way around the circle, we know that that's 360 degrees.
So, if we look at this graph over here, in 2006 sure enough, 80% liked Yummy Cola, then 2007. 76% that it keeps going to then 77%, then 73%, then 73 to the 68th. So this is actually accurate data.
(Laughter) (Applause) The best four minutes of my entire life were those in the Olympic stadium. My husband is offended when I say this -- although I have explained to him that what we do in private usually takes less than four minutes -- (Laughter)
I think I see a pattern here already. thirty, three, three times nine is twenty-seven.
Now, to go from 5 to 40, we have to multiply by 8, so we also have to do that for the numerator, so 1 times 8 is 8. So now we have 25/40 minus 40/40, which would be equal to-- we're going to have 40 as the denominator.
Six divided by three, what is that equal to? Let's just draw six objects. They can be anything.
Well, 6 to the third, we know that's 6 times itself three times. So it's 6 times 6 times 6. And then that's going to be times-- the times here is in green, so I'll do it in green.
And so we have this notion, just like we had in electrostatics, that a magnet generates a field. It generates these vectors around it, that if you put something in that field that can be affected by it, it'll be some net force acting on it. So actually, before I go into magnetic field, I actually want to make one huge distinction between magnetism and electrostatics.
This is the exact same fraction of the entire model over here. So when they say how many blocks in
Another way to find the LCM is take the prime factorization of 6 - 2x3 and the LCM of 6 must have one 2 &amp; one 3 what is the prime factorization of 8 is 2x2x2.
The government is monitoring private phone calls your children and my children's private phone calls and tracking who their associates are.
There's one fourth here and then another one fourth here. So one half is the same thing as two over four, and we know that from the equivalent fractions module. So we know that one fourth plus one half, this is the same thing as saying one fourth plus two fourths, right?
9 times 210 is going to be-- let's see. 9 times 0 is 0.
12 minus 7 is 5.
We're starting at negative 2, we're starting 2 to the left of 0.
Ninety plus ten is one hundred. So one hundred is zero tens plus one hundred. I don't know if this confuses you or not.
Bring down the 0. Actually, you don't have to write the decimal there. Ignore that decimal.
Now inside each of this villi, this finger-like projections is something called a central lacteal. The central lacteal is actually sort of a projection of the lymphatic system. The central lacteals are continuous with the lymphatic system.
So 3 doesn't go into 1.
like L.A. Yup, and I also look at popping and locking And why do like them so much? Is their style different to the style in the UK
So these add up to nine.
1, 2, 3, 4 of my equal sections have been colored blue. So I need to figure out which of these other folks have colored exactly 4/6 of their strip blue. Or another way of thinking about it, I want to say, whoever has an equivalent fraction colored, not blue, colored whatever their color might be.
Find the place value of 3 in 4,356.
Let's do one or two more problems.
So 27 divided by negative 12, well, they're both divisible by 3. So we're going to get, if we divide the numerator and the denominator by 3, we get negative 9 over 4 is less than-- these cancel out-- y. So y is greater than negative 9/4, or negative 9/4 is less than y.
Diya is looking to buy a plot of land to build her home on. She finally narrows her search to two plots that both have good locations. The plot at 314159 Apple Lane has a width of 30 meters and a length of 40 meters.
Once again we have three identical objects they all have the same mass, but we don't know what the mass is. But we do know that if you total up their mass, it is the same exact mass as these nine objects. and each of these 9 masses have a mass of exactly 1 kilogram. So we have a total of 9 kg on this side, and over here we have 3 objects that all have the same mass but we don't know what that mass is, we are just calling that mass 'X'.
Add nine to that. Twenty-seven plus nine is thirty-six. Thirty-six plus nine is forty-five.
4 times 3 is 12. Let's put the 2 right here. It should be in the tens place because this is really a 40 times the 3.
This was one group, two group, three groups.
So that 1/4 is the same thing as 2/8.
8 minus 4 is 4. Bring down this 0.
Negative 12 is less than 2 minus 5x, which is less than or equal to 7. I want to do a problem that has just the less than and a less than or equal to.
80 plus 40 is 120. Then we're going to have the 1 plus the 9, that's another 10, so this is going to be equal to 130. So let me write it this way.
If the trip home takes 39 minutes, at what time does Chris have to leave in order to be home by a quarter after 6:00? So let's draw a time line and then think about what has to happen here.
If I had two to the eighth times two to the twentieth. Well, we know we can add these exponents. So that gives you two to the twenty-eighth, right?
Now let's ask ourselves, what could such artifacts say about us to people 4,000 years into the future? This is no hypothetical question. In fact, this is exactly the kind of question we're faced with when we try to understand the Indus Valley civilization, which existed 4,000 years ago.
Then that tells us that x and y are-- and this is a fancy word, and it's just good to commit this to memory-- they are supplementary angles.
Well, 6/100 is definitely smaller than 6/10. A hundredth is a tenth of a tenth. So this one is pretty straightforward.
They can go to -1, -2---they can even go to -1.5, -1.6. The more and more negative, the more you lose. If you're adding, if I go and get my paycheck,
Ten should not work.
Ben: My name is Ben Milne, I'm CEO of a company called Dwolla and Dwolla's kind of core purpose in life is to allow anybody with an internet connection secure access to their money and allow them to exchange it with anybody else who can receive it without paying interchange costs. I had another company before and essentially all the product we sold we sold online.
(Laughter) There's no reason only poor people should have the experience.
Used to have this new four new, 6 times 6, 6 times 6 is 36, plus 4 is 40. Plus 480. So if you really, well, it's interesting to think what we got incrementally by adding that, that one hundredth over there because this part over here, well, we'll see, actually, when we add all this up.
Joey is training for a hot dog eating contest. The person who eats the most hot dogs in 10 minutes is the winner.
Well we already figured out what 3 to the fifth is, 3 to the fifth is 3 times 3 times 3 times 3 times 3. It's 243. So this expression right here is 243.
A theater has a total of 63 seats in a rectangular grid. Here they are right over here.
I'm going to warm-up with a couple of straight-up multiplying fractions or multiplying rational number problems-- rational number is just another way to say fractions, it's just any number that can be expressed as a fraction.
(Laughter) (Applause) Where the percentage of illiteracy is very high, we use puppetry. Puppets is the way we communicate.
So 95/12 is 7 and 11/12. And we're done! The difference between Shelagh and Luana's age is 7 and 11/12, or Shelagh is 7 and 11/12 years older than Luana.
And we've done our problem.
And so the corresponding angle is right over here.
68 - 42 = 26. And you can check that for yourself. If you add 26 + 42, you should get 68.
lets bring another zero down here and 21 goes into 190, lets see I think 9 will work
So it's 0.30 times x = 15. And now, to solve this, we just have to divide both sides by 0.30. Let's do that.
So 0.75 goes into 50 the same number of times that seventy-five goes into five thousand.
51.8 decimeters is equal to 0.00518 kilometers. And always do a reality check. Does that make sense?
So we have 8/36 = 10/n.
Conversations in Gmail have been redesigned to improve readability and to feel more like a real conversation. We've also added profile pictures so you can see who said what. You can also create a filter from the search box.
4 and 1/2 written as an improper fraction is equal to what? We're still going to have 2 as a denominator. So 2 times 4 is 8.
And for every group of eleven, you're going to have four boys and seven girls that's all that tells me.
It's also the very first letter of the word shalan, which means "something" just like the the English word "something" -- some undefined, unknown thing. Now in Arabic, we can make this definite by adding the definite article "al." So this is al-shalan -- the unknown thing.
Once the chyme has passed through the pyloric sphincter it enters into the first part of the small intestine and that part of the small intestine is called the duodenum. I'll just write that in, duodenum.
And you could imagine half a circle is 180 degrees.
Well the best way of getting rid of a negative 5 is to add five to it. So I'll do that. So I will add five to the left-hand side.
1/9. Which is equal to-- this is 1 divided by 1/9 is the same thing is 1 times 9, so this is equal to 9. And this makes complete sense, because 1/3, remember, 1/3 is the same thing as 3 to the negative 1 power, right?
So it's 1.2 liters of water.
So 0.09 goes into 3 the same number of times that nine goes into three hundred.
(Applause) Look at what Rojadeen has done. In Motihari in Champaran, there are a lot of people who sell tea on the shack and, obviously, there's a limited market for tea.
So what happens if I had negative two times three?
Dividing by a number is the same thing as multiplying by the inverse of that number.
2 times 25 is 50. And now we subtract again.
At the age of 70, he is linking up something very creative.
You could've done that in your head. two into forty is twenty times. So 4 divided by 0.2 is 20. So the answer is four is twenty percent of twenty.
0 times 15 is 0. Subtract. No remainder.
You could've said, well, I have a 2 in the numerator and
So what we'll do is take 5 into 6.
let's add 150 on this side, too, what do we get? What do we get?
So we have -1 as our rise. We went down. Our run was +3.
Negative 1 times negative 15 is positive 15. So these two statements are equivalent.
What's 0.04 times 1,000? It's 40.
15 is the same thing as 3*5. So once again, we already have 3 and 5. So, this is our least common multiple (LCM).
So 8 goes into-- it doesn't go into 7 at all, but it does go into 70.
Four times five is twenty. And the remainder is three. So twenty-three over five, we can say that's equal to four, and in the remainder, three over five.
So 3x plus 6 is equal to 231. Now, let's get rid of the 6 from the left-hand side of the equation.
Most liquids, when cooled, will simply shrink. Water, on the other hand, actually expands when it is frozen.
And let's add the constants. You have a negative 25 plus a 50, which is 25. And then you have 25 minus 125, so 25 minus 125 is negative 100.
After the last video, if you paid a lot of attention to why Spout wasn't backing up, you realize that it was because there wasn't enough friction between the axle of the motor and the surface Spout was running on. So we're going to apply some electrical tape to the axles of the motors to increase the amount of friction between the motor and the surface of the table - so when Spout bumps into something, he's able to back up right away. So we should see an increase in both the speed of Spout's movement and his ability to react to the environment around him.
(Laughter) (Applause) Because unfortunately for men, sleep deprivation has become a virility symbol. I was recently having dinner with a guy who bragged that he had only gotten four hours sleep the night before.
Well think about it this way, we know that X plus Y is equal to 5. So if we were to get rid of an X and a Y on this side,on the left hand side of the equation. What would we have to get rid of on the right hand side of the, or if we know if we get rid of X and Y on the left hand side of the scale
So we have 5/8 minus 1/5. Now, just like when you're adding fractions, when you're subtracting fractions, you have to have a common denominator.
That's 2. So that equals 40. In general, in my head, and you'll learn to do these problems, in your head.
I don't think this works for eight, or seven or eleven or seventeen. Why does this work for nine?
So if we are looking at 3 its opposite in this context we have 0 here, 3 is here to the right so we go to the left of 0 for opposite and we move the same distance 3 , so we have -3 So now 3 and -3 are opposites No lets do 100, and -100 is the opposite
And 3 plus 2 was equal to 5.
(Laughter) But grassroots groups are needed at the table during the decision-making process. Of the 90 percent of the energy that Mr. Gore reminded us that we waste every day, don't add wasting our energy, intelligence and hard-earned experience to that count.
I get 2x is equal to 1 plus 6, which is 7. Divide both sides by 2, you get x is equal to 7 over 2. I went through this a little bit faster.
Well, that's 8 plus 12, which is, indeed, equal to 20, so that works out. Our width is going to be 4 feet, and our length is going to be 6 feet.
If you click on that, the task disappears.
4 x 25 is 100, and then you subtract and you get zero. so we actually didn't even have to round this one. This fraction is exactly, this is exactly 0.44.
One-third times negative 12 is negative 4, so this is negative 4 plus 'b'. Let me write that plus 'b' in the same colour that I started with. And now just isolate 'b' on the right hand side, we can add 4 to both sides.
And then you count how many digits are after the three.
Growing up in Taiwan as the daughter of a calligrapher, one of my most treasured memories was my mother showing me the beauty, the shape and the form of Chinese characters. Ever since then, I was fascinated by this incredible language. But to an outsider, it seems to be as impenetrable as the Great Wall of China.
Twelve divided by three. Now based on what we've learn so far, we say, that should just be four, because three times four is twelve. But let's prove it to ourselves.
Consider the numbers 1/3 , 7 , -15 To which of these sets of numbers these numbers belong to. Lets review each of these
Now I'm going to multiply a 10 times 26, gets us to 260. And you add these two together. You get 390.
32 is 2 times 16.
2 times 6 is 12.
If you do 2.999999 minus 2, you get 0.999999, which is less than 1. And you can keep trying for any of these numbers in this pink solution set here.
So that is equal to Ali's age in 4 years. Let's read what other information there is in the problem. It says, in 4 years.
I'm in the mood to improve my flexibility a little bit so I decide to take some Yoga classes so I show up at the local yoga place called Super Yoga and ask them, "how much does it cost?" And they say, "we've got a basic plan"
Well, there are going to be 50 minus 1 incremental houses. Why minus 1?
So minus 21 over 2, minus 21 over 2. The left-hand side-- you're just left with a 4y, because these two guys cancel out-- is equal to-- this is 5 minus 21 over 2. That's negative 16 over 2.
And the little trick here is I want to write- instead of writing 100, I want to write this as the sum of 1 plus something that is divisible by 3
The absolute value of 0 is 0, so you can just plot it right over there. And we have one left. Let me pick a suitable color here.
So this whole thing simplifies to 8 divided by negative 4 is negative 2 plus 2. So it equals 0. So this big, hairy thing simplified to 0.
100 deciliters is how many centiliters?
Let's try this out, 7 small tiles and 5 large tiles. This is going to be 5 square feet per large tile times 5 large tiles-- you've got to make sure you've got your reading comprehension correctly-- plus 2 square feet per small tile times 7 small tiles is going to be equal to 25 plus 14, which is equal to 39, which is not equal to 40. So that does not satisfy it either.
We get 3 times 4 times negative 1 plus 6. So that is 3 times negative 4 plus 6.
An investment firm creates a graph showing the performance of a specific stock over 12 months. Over the course of the year, is the prices of the stock rising, falling or staying the same? So over on this axis here, the horizontal axis, they have month by month and we move forward in time; July, August, September, October...And on this axis, the vertical axis, we have the price.
And it's a good thing to have in the back of your brain someplace, that in general you have 5,280 feet per mile. It's a good number to know. 5,280 feet per mile.
We see that it much closer to 423,000 than to 424,000, so we round it right there. But you just use the rules we just came up with, and we rounded down to 423,000.
Tarush is five times as old as Arman is today, eighty-five years ago.
So I can't go further in A's direction than A But I can go further in D's direction So this little this idea that I just showed;
9.1 times 3.2. So first, I'm going to ignore the decimal. I'm just going to treat it like 91 times 32.
(Laughter) "Like, how lame is that?" And I say, "No, no, it tells the date as well."
There are some good arguments for why it should be zero, because zero to pretty much any other power is zero. But then there's a really good argument for why it should be 1, because any other number to the zeroth power is 1. So thats why for the most part we like to keep this undefined.
So notice, 3 over 20 is the exact same thing.
Well, 20 is how many tenths? Well, you have 10 tenths per 1. So 20 is 200 tenths.
5x is less than 12 plus 3 is 15.
We said, after 4 exams we had an 84. What do I have to get on that next exam to average an 88 in the class after 5 exams? And that's what we solved for when we got x.
60 plus 36. It's equal to 96/16. So it's 9 minus 96 over 16z.
And 8 times 55 is indeed 440. So it all worked out. So maybe you want to see what happens when you get different "a"s.
I guess we could call it the metal box volume. When you take the tank volume and subtract out the box volume, that's how much the water can actually fill in. So I only drew the water partially filled.
This problem 10 looks a little bit more daunting.
5-12 So if we start at 5-- let me use a different color-- we start at 5 right here and we're going to go to the left 12 because we're subtracting 12 So then we go 1,2,3...
Well, when we had a rectangle like this, we just multiplied 7 times 4. But what would that give us? That would give us the area of an entire rectangle.
A woman named Aomame in 1984 Japan finds herself negotiating down a spiral staircase off an elevated highway. When she gets to the bottom, she can't help but feel that, all of a sudden, she's entered a new reality that's just slightly different from the one that she left, but very similar, but different. And so, we're talking about parallel planes of existence, sort of like a book jacket and the book that it covers.
The measure of angle XYZ, is greater than the measure of the angle ABC. Any measure of angles, is based on how open, or closed they are which we will see in the next vidoes
You do it over here, you get negative seven is less than or equal to x, and x is less than or equal to fifteen over three which is five. This statement and this statement are completely equal. Now we've solved for x.
Let's see, what's the bottom one? Well this fits a pattern. A squared minus b squared, right?
0.75m. I have, like, five shades of this purple here. so this is that, that is that, and then these two guys canceled out. Now to solve for m, I can just divide both sides by 0.75.
So what's 9+9? So if you don't know what it is, you can work it out either using the number line or drawing the circles. And, you know that's a fair way to do it, although you should eventually kind of know it.
So now we are left with 1,143,952 So which of these just gets us right under that? So let's see, if we want to go to- we can't go straight to 1746
Sandy is taking a cab in New York City. The taxi fare includes a base charge of $2.50 as soon as you enter the cab, plus an additional $2.50 per mile traveled.
And then finally this 8.
And so, we would calculate it the same way, y two minus y one over x two minus x one.
5 is not divisible by 2, so 2 will not go into 75. So then we could try 3.
I just take minus one hundred plus one hundred two. This is a five. I'm sorry for that brain malfunction.
Let's do a little bit of practice dividing rational numbers, or another way to think about it, dividing fractions.
45 minus 20, and that is equal to 25, so this is using the distributive property right here. If we didn't want to use the distributive property, if we just wanted to evaluate what's in the parentheses first, we would have gotten-- let's go in this direction-- 5 times-- what's 9 minus 4?
The perimeter of Tina's rectangular garden is 60 feet. If the length of the garden is twice the width - the length is twice the width - what are the dimensions of the garden? So, let's draw this garden here:
So they did indeed all go, or they all did move at the same speed during the experiment.
Queues of people start lining up at my house (Laughter) to charge their mobile phone.
So we have, we have 0.0104, 0.0104 times 3600, 3600 gives us 37., I'll just stay 37.4 so this is equal to 37.4, 37.4 kilometers.
Then, the French imposed their brilliantly conceived airline tax to create a something called UNlTAlD, got a bunch of other countries to help. That children's medicine is now 60 dollars a person a year. The only thing that is keeping us from basically saving the lives of everybody who needs the medicine to stay alive are the absence of systems necessary to diagnose, treat and care for people and deliver this medicine.
There's a certain -- (Laughter) That's true in everything risky, except technology. For some reason, there's no standard syilabus, there's no basic course.
The product of -2 and X is -2X. So 7 plus -2X. We could write it as 7 minus 2X.
And we are done. Another way we could have done it-- we didn't necessarily have to simplify that. And let me show you that just for fun.
So a 4 in thousands is 4,000. A 4 in hundreds would be 1/10 as much. A 4 in the tens would be 1/10 as much as that.
30/8 is the same thing as 15/4. Oh, and actually I made a mistake here.
So when x is 4, you have negative 4 times 4, which is negative 16, plus 8, which is negative 8. So it seems to be able to generate this first point. When x is 4, y is negative 8 for this equation right over here.
Your car gets 25 miles per gallon, per gallon and you want to go on a 400 mile road trip. Right now, gas costs $3 per gallon. How much will the gas for your road trip cost?
Fast-forward, 2004: In the peak of our activism, the minister of Gender Liberia called me and said, "Leymah, I have a nine-year-old for you.
So then we have to go another 9 minutes to go to 549. So you have 9 minutes left over. So another way of thinking about this, is that 549 is 9 hours.
So the type of magic I like, and I'm a magician, is magic that uses technology to create illusions. So I would like to show you something I've been working on. It's an application that I think will be useful for artists -- multimedia artists in particular.
405. That is 5 times-- I think it's 81.
Pedro is supposed to practice piano for 3/4 of an hour every day. Today, he has practiced for 1/4 of an hour.
And 23 is a prime number, so we're done. 92 is 2 times 2 times 23.
i think you can see that the ball landed in exactly the same position of the did before when doctor whom did the experiment with the car text but this time the ball could not have fallen straight down let me show you off the ball was released at that point if it had fallen straight down because the cart moves on in the time to take the fall would have landed back here somewhere but it didn't wanted to do the experiment again best time i'm going to let you watch the motion through slow-motion camera which is fixed the cart moves by the ball will fall and you can watch a missile which the camera
Well, he pays a 25% diamond pony tax. So whatever the price is, he's going to pay 25% of that.
Am I going to travel more than three hundred and thirty-six or am I going to travel less than three hundred and thirty-six inches per second. Well obviously less, because a second is a much shorter period of time. So if I'm in a much shorter period of time, I'm going to be traveling a much shorter distance, if I'm going the same speed.
So it's going to be over forty five, till from nine to forty-five to multiply by five so I'm gonna have to multiply the numerator by five.
So we're asked to add 3/15 plus 7/15, and then simplify the answer.
9+9 is equal to 18...so 9+9... and you put the 8 down here and you carry the 1. And now you just say 1+9.
Welcome to the presentation on units. Let's get started. So if I were to tell you -- let me make sure my pen is set up right -- if I were to tell you that someone is, let's say they're driving at a speed of -- let's say it's Zack.
So you can pass them to the function "type" so now it should print the type of 3+7, not just 10. Let's try that. I'll just print 2-1 to just show you the difference.
3 times anything divided by 3 is going to be that anything we're just going to have an x left over on the left hand side And on the right hand side what's 14*3 310 is 30, 34 is 12, so it's going to be 42 So we get x=42
So instead, we write seven over eight are shaded red. Or seven out of eight. So let's do that.
like what you'd see in a Do Not Smoking sign if there was a cigarette behind it, so this little slash between the inside of a circle below. So 9 times 6. Well, multiplication is also commutative.
-- on my tiptoes -- holding the flag on my extended arm, so that my head was actually under the damn flag.
We're asked to identify the numerator and denominator in the fraction three over four, or three-fourths. Let's rewrite this, so it's nice and big. So let me just write the fraction.
The treasures I am talking about to you, follow a different law: if you cling to them they shrink, if you cling too much you can even kill them.
These little green dots you see right here all over the surface, this big thing you see here, this is a white blood cell. Part of the human immune system. This is a white blood cell.
And what can we add or subtract to both sides of the equation to get rid of this negative 2? Well, if we add 2 to the left-hand side, these two guys will cancel out. But remember, this is equal to that.
And so we have 0 days after Monday, we have 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. And then on Monday, which is exactly 0 days after Monday, that is Monday, we have 12 inches on the ground. So I'll do it up here, so we have 12 inches on the ground right there.
And this will essentially describe this-- though, if you can imagine a particle and let's say the parameter t represents time. It'll describe where the particle is at any given time. And if we wanted a particular curve we can say, well, this only applies for some curve-- we're dealing, it's r of t.
So two times ten?
DNA is a double stranded molecule composed of sugar, phosphate, and four different bases, adenine, thymine, cytosine, and guanine. These bases spell out the language known as the genetic code.
So here we're told that the giraffe at the zoo is 3 times taller than Shantanu. Shantanu is 6 feet tall. How tall is the giraffe?
So we have one whole pie and three pieces, which are each a fourth left over.
You're probably used to something like the "metric" system. And Euclid is considered to be the father of geometry. (not because he was the first person who studied geometry), you could imagine the very first humans might have studied geometry.
When x is 4, y is negative 4. So they skip 2 right over here. y is negative 4.
eight, nine, ten, I have to include that number.
20 fourths. Or we could write it as 20/4. I've kind of done the same thing twice.
Now if you're divisible by both, you need to have two 2's, a 3, and a 5. two 2's and a 3 for 12, and then two 2's and a 5 for 20 and you can verify this for yourself if this is divisible by both Obviously, if you divide it by 20, is the same thing as dividing it by 2 times 2 times 5
So let's just divide 300 by 7 and see where we get. 7 goes into 30 4 times. 4 times 7 is 28.
And that's the only constant term.
So 1/2 base times height. So in our example it's going to be 1/2 times 7 centimeters times 4 centimeters.
So you're starting with 1/3 of a gallon of water. They tell us that when it gets frozen, when it turns into ice, its volume is going to expand by 9%. So the new volume is going to be your existing volume.
Negative twenty-one is less than or equal to 3x.
We're asked to select which fractions add together to make 25 over 22, or 25/22. You can use as many fractions as you need. Put all unused fractions into the trash can.
And then finally, we have the absolute value of negative 3. That's 3 to the left of 0. or you can just think of it as getting rid of the negative sign So it is equal to 3
Let's say we do eight hundred and twenty-three and then let's throw some -- an arbitrary number of zero's there. So this first one, right here, what we do if we want to write in scientific notation, we want to figure out the largest exponent of ten that fits into it. So we go to its first non-zero term, which is that right there.
don't bother whether this is a friend or a foe.
If you hover over the task, you will see a Decline option appear.
So we're 3 away from zero, we're going to go 7 more away from zero
And then let's add another 2/8, plus another 2/8. Well, this is in eighths right over here, so 2/8 is going to be two of these.
And of course, it would originally have been erected in a temple, or near an ancient Egyptian temple. And, I suppose it's important to say that this is the bottom portion of a much larger stele - or sort of stone tablet - that would have been quite tall.
And the prime factorization of 30 is equal to, let's see, it's 3 &amp;times; 10, and 10 is 2 &amp;times; 5 So, what are the &lt;i&gt;most&lt;/i&gt; factors that we could take from both 21 and 30 to make the largest possible numbers? When you look at the prime factorization, the only thing that's common right over here is a 3
I've been intrigued by this question of whether we could evolve or develop a sixth sense -- a sense that would give us seamless access and easy access to meta-information or information that may exist somewhere that may be relevant to help us make the right decision about whatever it is that we're coming across. And some of you may argue, "Well, don't today's cell phones do that already?"
I always used to get confused between seven times eight being fifty-six and six times nine being fifty-four.
An expression would be something like. well, what we saw over here: x + 5 The value of this expression will change depending on what the value of this variable is. And you could just evaluate it for different values of x
5y plus 4 over 3 And you see it interpreted properly We got it right
So 27 going into 19. And we know it's going to involve some decimals over here, because 27 is larger than 19, and it doesn't divide perfectly. So let's get into this.
When they have their kids, 2050, they'd better look back at Grandpa and say,
(Laughter) Augusten Burroughs wrote a memoir called ["Dry"], and it's about his time in rehab.
So it's 35, plus 2 is 37. Now, we write the 7 right over here in the tens place and carry the 3. Now we need to compute what 7 times 2 is.
This is, have greater than 1/5 year cell phone.
Welcome to Part 2 on the presentation on Level 1 exponent rules. So let's start off by reviewing the rules we've learned already. If I had 2 to the tenth times 2 to the fifth, we learned that since we're multiplying exponents with the same base, we can add the exponent, so this equals 2 to the fifteenth.
Obviously, 5/8 will still be 5/8.
70 years ago, it took one man to infect an entire nation with the power of "We can."
Well, 137, just looking at it, is clearly closer to 100. Or we could apply our rule. If we're rounding to the nearest 100, we want to look at one place to the right of that.
113.9 ÷ 100. If you divide a number by 10, you move the decimal once to the left. If you divide a number by 100, you're moving the decimal twice to the left.
First let's think about 24.
(Laughter) (Applause) Bye-bye.
The cashiers at your grocery store, the foreman at your plant, the guy tailgating you home on the highway, the telemarketer calling you during dinner, every teacher you've ever had, everyone that's ever woken up beside you, every politician in every country, every actor in every movie, every single person in your family, everyone you love, everyone in this room and you will be dead in a hundred years. Life is so great that we only get such a short time to experience and enjoy all those tiny little moments that make it so sweet. And that moment is right now, and those moments are counting down, and those moments are always, always, always fleeting.
PROBLEM: "Consider the following coordinate pairs." (And they give us a bunch right over here.)
Just like the previous one,
27 goes into 10 0 times.
They add to 18, which is clearly divisible by 3, and these two things will add up to 9. So the important thing to know, is that when you add up all the digits, the sum is divisible by three So this is divisible by three, as well.
If this 1 is in the ten-thousands place, that means that it literally represents-- I want to do this in a way that my arrows don't get mixed up. Actually, let me start at the other end. Let me start with what the 7 represents.
It not only has to be negative, it has to be less than or equal to negative 8.5. We know that if you take the absolute value of anything, you're going to get 0 or a positive number. You're going to get a non-negative number.
3 times 2 minus 2 plus this 3 times x. But x is also now equal to 3. So what is this going to be equal to?
Now, what's 8/8?
152, we're going to round to 200, which also makes sense.
Well, the British defeated Napoleon, and brought back the stone. And a year or two later - I think, 1801 or 1802 - it's brought to the British Museum.
In the early '80s, I had a really astonishing assignment when I was asked by my professor at Harvard if I was interested in going down to Haiti, infiltrating the secret societies which were the foundation of Duvalier's strength and Tonton Macoutes, and securing the poison used to make zombies. In order to make sense out of sensation, of course, I had to understand something about this remarkable faith of Vodoun.
So 1/2 times 3 times the height of the triangle.
190 times 2 is-- yeah, that's 2 times 196. 196 is 2 times-- I want to make sure I don't make a careless mistake.
If I were to ask you what two to the ninth over two to the tenth equals-- Wow! That looks like that could be a little confusing.
5 plus 0 plus 7 is 12. You write the 2 in the hundredths place, and carry the 1.
Three could also be written as, minus 9 over 3. I'm skipping some steps, but I think you, you know your fractions pretty good by this point.
This part right over here is going to be 5. x + 5 = 5 And so what + 5 = 5?
So 4 meets this constraint so even 4 works. So it's really the entire the number line will satisfy either one or both of these constraints.
We know that 4 times 25 is 100, so 25 goes into 100 four times.
2 showed up five times, 3 showed up to two times, 4 showed up one time, 5 didn't show up, and 6 showed up one time.
Part I was the square root of 0.1, which is equal to the square root of 1/10, which is equal to the square root of 1 over the square root of 10, which is equal to 1 over-- now, the square root of 10-- 10 is just 2 times 5. So that doesn't really help us much. So that's just the square root of 10 like that.
-5, -6, -7, -8 So we move to the right 6 and down 8 we move to the right 6 then we move down 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 and we are right over there so that is the point (6, -8) you can also move at it this way so you move 6 there so we will be along this line here and then you can go and then the y coordinate is -8 and you say we will be along this line over here and the place they intersect is this coordinate the way i like to think of it move 6 to the right move along the x axis and then move along in the y axis so you go down 8
Let's think a little bit about powers of zero.
So hopefully that gives you a little bit of background, and I really encourage you to try the next exercise, It will give you a lot of practice on being to evaluate expressions like this.
I should should be able to distribute this five and for math to be consistent, and math should be consistent, I should get the exact same answer, so let's distribute this five so we get five times three is going to write out as five times three
Another way to do it and this is actually the exact same way we are just phrasing it a little different if you said 5 x equals 20 instead of dividing by 5 we could multiply by one fifth and if you look at that you could realize that multiplying by one fifth is the same thing as dividing by five if you know the difference between dividing and multiplying fractions. and then that gets the same thing one fifth times 5 is 1 so you're left with an x equals 4 i tend to focus a little bit more on this because when we start having fractions instead of a five it's easier to just think about multiplying by the reciprocle actually let's do one of those right now so let's say I had negative 3 over 4 times x equals 10 over 13 now this is a harder problem I can't do this one in my head
7 times something divided by 7 is only
Another way to think about this is that 0 times anything is going to become 0. So either one of the ways of thinking about it would have gotten you the same answer. Actually we can even write 1*x =x
(Laughter) She walked elegantly, like a giraffe on the African savannah, holding the flag on her shoulder. I jogged behind (Laughter)
You have negative 6x plus 14y is equal to negative 2. Let's add 6x to both sides of the equation.
And if you wanted to check it, you could just take that x equals negative five / six and put it back in the original question to confirm that it worked. Let's do another one.
"Clean Coal." Has anybody noticed that?
We're now going to learn how to go from mixed numbers to improper fractions and vice versa. So first a little bit of terminology. What is a mixed number?
A carpenter is using a lathe to shape the final leg of a hand-crafted table. A lathe is this carpentry tool that spins things around, and so it can be used to make things that are, I guess you could say, almost cylindrical in shape, like a leg for a table or something like that. In order for the leg to fit, it needs to be 150 millimeters wide, allowing for a margin of error of 2.5 millimeters.
The next 13.5% of our population are our early adopters. The next 34% are your early majority, your late majority and your laggards. The only reason these people buy touch-tone phones is because you can't buy rotary phones anymore.
15 units times 4 units is gonna be 60 square units. And what's the perimeter?
- 3 (5). And so 10 (-1), that is -10 and we're going to subtract from that 3 (5). You want to do the multiplication first by order of operations that's the convention.
70 minus 68 is 2, bring down another 0.
Here I added the 5, kind of, on the same line. You could also do your adding or subtracting below the line, like this. So if I subtract 15 from both sides, so I do a minus 15 there, and I do a minus 15 there.
8 goes into 9 one time with 1 left over, so it's 1 and 1/8. So this is the same thing as 3 plus 1 and 1/8. So now we can add the whole number parts.
And if we can quiet it down and walk in and say, "I'm going to do this," we look up and the critic that we see pointing and laughing, 99 percent of the time is who? Us. Shame drives two big tapes --
What's Ben's age 12 years ago? Well, maybe we want to express it in terms of B. If it's 'B' now, 12 years ago it was just 'B - 12'.
1 is the same thing as 4/4, and then you have three more fourths, so 4/4 plus 3/4 will give you 7/4.
So this is going to be equal to minus 3 minus 4 times 2, minus 8, all of that over-- 3 times 5 is 15, plus 2 times negative 4 is negative 8, or 15 plus negative 8 is 15 minus 8. And now, the numerator becomes negative 3 minus 8, which is negative 11. And the denominator is 15 minus 8, which is 7.
So we're going to write 4/9 as something over 36, and we're going to write 11/12 as something over 36. Now, to turn your 9 into a 36, you have to multiply it by 4, right? 9 times 4 is equal to 36.
Well, 100 is divisible by 2, so 100 is actually the least common multiple of 100 and 2. So we really have to just find the least common multiple between 100 and 300. And that's just going to be 300.
3 and 5 don't share any common factors greater than 1, so it is in simplest form. So we've done what they asked. We've written it as a fraction in simplest form.
And, one of those people who accompanied Napoleon found - or came across - the Rosetta Stone.
When you divided 3x into groups of three, each of the groups had an x in it.
Let's go ahead. if we wanna get rid og the 3/4, all we do is subtarct 3/4 from both sides On the left hand side the 3/4 just cancel out, and we get minus 1/2 x equal. On the right hand side we have do the fraction subtraction. the least common multiple of 6 and 4 is 12. that becomes 10 minus 9.
We're going to have 6 times 5 is 30.
What's another way to think about 9 squared to the third power?
So 60 is going to go into 540 9 times. We're going to have a little bit left over.
What's -3+5? Well, let's use the same number line.
So right now we have twenty boys.
Now what about area of a square? Well, a square is just a special case where the length and the width are the same. So if I have a square-- let me draw a square here.
I had 4 lemons for breakfast. So 1, 2, 3, 4 lemons for breakfast. And let's say I had another 3 lemons for lunch.
Don't you feel? (Laughter) So, this whole event has been an elaborate build-up to me doing another one for you, so here it is.
8 times 5 is 40. Subtract. You get a 0.
And then let y be equal to inches of snow on the ground. So, one way to think about it is, OK, when x is 0, when we're on Monday, when we're 0 days after Monday, we're going to have 12 inches of snow on the ground, and every day after that, we're going to lose two inches. So if we're on Tuesday, we're going to have 2 inches times 1, because Tuesday is one day, so if x is 1, that means we're on Tuesday.
8 out of 11. And once again, I could try to get a numerator up here, 4, I could divide by 2.
So 6.7 gets us pretty close, but we're still not, we're still not probably right to the hundreds, well, it's definitely not to the hundreds place since we've only gone To the tenth place right over here.
So it actually works out perfectly.
So let's put it in point slope form. All we have to do is we say y minus-- now we could have taken either of these points, I'll take this one-- so y minus the y value over here, so y minus 6 is equal to our slope, which is negative 2/3 times x minus our x-coordinate.
They give us what happens to y when x is negative 2, when it's 1, when it's 2, when it's 4. So maybe we can backtrack from one of these to get back to what happens when x is equal to 0. So let me rewrite this table so I can give ourselves a little bit more breathing room.
11 goes into 10 zero times.
Eleven plus one hundred ten is one hundred twenty-one. And actually, as you'll see, there actually is an order as we get to higher multiples of eleven, but I'll leave that to a future video. And then finally, we're at eleven times twelve.
1 minus 0 is 1.
Well, if we do the decimal division, 0.09 goes into 3. Let's put a decimal point here. I don't know how many zero's I'm going to need.
So, when 25 goes into 110 four times (4 x 25 is 100), so it goes into it 4 times let's keep the decimal up here, so we'll write 0.4 4 times 25 is 100, and now we can subtract: 110 minus 100 is 10.
And I'm going to be really honest with you. When I became a "vulnerability researcher" and that became the focus because of the TED talk -- and I'm not kidding. I'll give you an example.
The 12.60 becomes 126, put the decimal right there. Decimal right there. And we're ready to just do straight up long division.
And in a moment, I will see the Dutch review tasks. Now if I want to perform a review task, I'm only interested at this time in the reviews that are unassigned, because the other ones are already being worked on by other people.
[Inaudible] &gt;&gt; Being. &gt;&gt; You. &gt;&gt; Opening. &gt;&gt; Receive. &gt;&gt; Compassion. &gt;&gt; Love. &gt;&gt; The principles of cultural humility offer one more framework to contribute to what has got to be our ultimate goal, yes. Our ultimate goal is that there will be a sense of equity, a sense of equality and a kind of respect that we are driving forward.
(Applause) When I was growing up, my dad used to love telling the story of his first day in Canada. And it's a great story, because what happened was he got off the plane at the Toronto airport, and he was welcomed by a non-profit group, which I'm sure someone in this room runs.
So what is the slope between a, b and x, y? Well, our change in y-- remember slope is just change in y over change in x.
Well, the largest number that I can think of that goes into 48-- you could do it either by just thinking about it or you could actually write out all of its factors. But if you were to write all the factors for 48 and all the factors for 64, the one that pops out at me as the largest that goes into both is 16. So you could say that 48 is equal to-- well, what is it?
And we could simplify this. We have a 1 and we have a minus 4, or I guess we're subtracting 4 from it, so this is going to be equal to 4x minus 3 is the number of blocks given our x term. So if we're on term 50, it's going to be 4 times 50, which is 200 minus 3, which is 197 blocks.
"Would you like to see the situation of Iraq? Would you like to see civil war, sectarian killing? Would you like to see destruction?
6.71. So once again, we have to do some arithmetic by hand. We are assuming that they don't want us to use a calculator here.
So you get negative sixteen, which is less than or equal to negative sixteen, which is less than or equal to twenty. And you could try other values. You could go outside of our solution set.
9 times 2 is 18. And then we subtract again.
I understand that some bedbugs have been found at the United Nations building in New York, which is unfortunate, but some good may come of it - you never know. Maybe somebody could find a place for them on the Human Rights Council. They may help to elevate the integrity of that forum somewhat.
7/100 multiplied by 10 is 70/1000. And let's do that over here.
If you put ten here, you get three times ten plus five is thirty-five.
These are the people who spent 40,000 dollars on flat-screen TVs when they first came out, even though the technology was substandard. And, by the way, they didn't do it because the technology was so great; they did it for themselves. It's because they wanted to be first.
I don't know, you're kind of alienating a large client there. (Laughter) One publisher, Action Publishing, was willing to take that leap and trust me, and to listen to what I had to say.
Anything times 1 is going to be that anything, whatever this is. Whatever this is times 1 is going to be that same thing again. If I have just some kind of placeholder here times 1,
So it's equal to 5 times 2 over 6 times 3, which is equal to: 5 times 2 is 10 and 6 times 3 is 18, so it's equal to 10/18. And you could view this as either 2/3 of 5/6, or 5/6 of 2/3, depending on how you want to think about it.
I started with 7x is equal to 21. Instead of dividing by 7, I could have said, let me multiply by the inverse of 7. So I could have multiplied by the inverse of 7 on both sides of the equation.
25 minus 8 is 17. So 5/8 minus 1/5, which is the same thing as 25/40 minus 8/40, is equal to 17/40. And 17 is a prime number so it's not going to share any common factors with 40, or at least 40 isn't divisible by 17 either, so this is as simplified as we can get.
Let's see if we can find the cube root of 3,430. And if you're like me, it doesn't jump out of your mind what number times that same number times that same number-- if you have three of those numbers and you were to multiply them together-- would be equal to 3,430.
3 plus 2 is going to be equal to 5.
-- Use less than, greater than, or equal to compare the two fractions 21/28, or 21 over 28, and 6/9, or 6 over 9. So there's a bunch of ways to do this.
Well, this is going to be the same thing as negative 1/3 times the inverse of this, times negative 5/3. I just swapped the numerator and the denominator. So this is going to be equal to-- the negatives cancel out.
257, 257, 257 keeps going on and on forever. And then we are going to subtract X from that. so here is x; x is equal to 3.
Namaskaram (Hello in Tamil). Please play it.
12 times 3 is 36, and then we have these two zeroes, so it's equal to 3,600. So this is going to be 11 point something. It's larger than 11, right?
But this is saying what fraction 4 is of 16. You'd say, well, 4 is 1/4 of 16. But that still doesn't answer our question.
We didn't have any. And then when x is equal to 4, we had three columns. We had three columns there, when x is equal to 4.
You can view as starting with negative 7, so I was gonna draw a number line there.
First we know that AB = AC,
(minus 20, right over here). And then "-2" times "4y"...
Divide by 10 and then multiply by 10. Or another way to write it, or another way to think about it, is 4.0 and all this stuff times 10 is going to be 40.1534. And so you're going to have 4-- all of this times 10 to the first power, that's the same thing as 10-- times this thing-- times 10 to the negative ninth power.
So negative 5 divided by negative 2 is positive 2.5x.
So going back to where we started, if I were to say C is less than 1,500, the way we would depict that on a number line is-- let's say this is 0, this is 1,500, we want to make it very clear that we're not including the value 1,500. So we would put an open circle around it.
16 times 9 times 3 is equal to 432. So this is going to be equal to-- b is equal to the square root of 16 times 9, times 3, which is equal to the square root of 16, which is 4 times the square root of 9, which is 3, times the square root of 3, which is equal to 12 roots of 3.
4 times 3 is 12. You subtract. You're left with nothing here.
8/36 = 10/n. And we want to solve for n. The easiest way to solve for n is maybe multiply both-- this thing on the left is equal to this thing on the right.
It's not divisible by 2, 3 or 4 (you could divide 5 / 4 but you would get a remainder) And it is exactly divisible by 5, obviously. So once again, 5 is divisible by exactly two natural numbers:
Where does 1/2 sit, so it sits, let me actually make the scale a little bit better. So this is one, two and three, and four.
So a good thing to do, let's just distribute things out. y minus 7 is equal to negative 5 times x, negative 5x, plus negative 5, times negative 12, which is positive 60. Now, we want all of the variable terms on the left, all of the constant terms on the right. So let's add 7 to both sides of this equation.
If something is linear, then the change in y over the change in x always constant. Now, in this example, the change in x's are always 1, right? We go from 1 to 2, 2 to 3, 3 to 4, 4 to 5.
In 1957, five missionaries attempted contact and made a critical mistake. They dropped from the air 8 x 10 glossy photographs of themselves in what we would say to be friendly gestures, forgetting that these people of the rainforest had never seen anything two-dimensional in their lives. They picked up these photographs from the forest floor, tried to look behind the face to find the form or the figure, found nothing, and concluded that these were calling cards from the devil, so they speared the five missionaries to death.
9 minus 8 is 1. So we get 189. And now we can bring down another 0.
So we get vf squared is equal to 2 times force times distance. That's work. Took that definition right here.
We're asked to subtract. And we have the problem 68 - 42. And what I want to do here, is 1) just show you how I would do this problem, and then, talk a little bit about why it actually works.
I think you might be getting it now. Let's see, let's do a couple more. And, of course, you can always pause, and look at this whole presentation again, so you can get confused all over again.
Well, that's just 0.20 or 0.2. And we just multiply it by x to get four. So 20%, that's the same thing as 0.2.
So there's 120 equals 2 times something? Well, when you look here, maybe you immediately recognize that 120 is an even number. It's ones place is a 0.
I substituted for x, because they told us x is equal to this thing.
You get 5 minus 4 is 1.
Two-zero minus six. So this is essentially saying, "What is 200 - 60?" Well 20 - 6 is 14.
And, "Euclid's Elements" was essentially a 13-volume textbook (and arguably the most famous textbook of all time). And what he did in those thirteen volumes was a rigorous, thoughtful, logical march through geometry, number theory and solid geometry (geometry in three-dimensions).
So 1x plus 0.25x, well that's just the same thing as 1 plus 0.25, plus x-- we're just doing the distributive property in reverse-- equals one hundred.
So table four seems, like a completely reasonable, a completely reasonable scenario, and we can check our answer, and it is.
The left-hand side, negative 5 plus 4, is negative 1. Negative 1 is less than or equal to x, right? These 4's just cancel out here and you're just left with an x on this right-hand side.
1 times 15 is 15, two times 15 is 30, then if you add 15 again you get 45, you add 15 again you get 60, you add 15 again, you get 75, you add 15 again, you get 90, you add 15 again you get 105. and if still none of these are common multiples with these guys over here then you may have to go further, but I will stop here for now. Now that's the multiples of 15 up through 105. Obviously, we keep going from there.
7 hours, I might be running out of space, is for 420 minutes. Let me copy and paste this someplace where I have more real estate.
So 9 to the sixth is the answer. Now another way to view it, if you don't like that formula, is we could even apply other formulas.
91. Yep, that looks right.
I'm starting to take a little bit more care of my health, and I start counting my actual calories. And let's say C is equal to the number of calories
So let's take negative 1. And let's first raise it to the 0 power. So once again, this is just going, based on this definition, this is starting with a 1 and then multiplying it by this number 0 times.
Welcome to my presentation on level three linear, yeah, level three linear equations.
And we, once again, we're going to have 4 times 0 is 0, 4 times 0 is 0, 4 times 0 is 0, 4 times 1 is 4. Or we just did 4 times a thousand. So that is 4000, if you don't include this zero that we added here ahead of time because we're going one place to the left.
Negative 8 divided by 7 is negative 8/7.
And then Tarush, eighty-five years ago. No, I think I messed up someplace.
The inbox has gone Google. Again.
7 × 2 is 14, + 4 is 18. And now our remainder is 1. We can bring down another 0.
So negative 1 to the second power-- well, we could start with a 1.
We have 2 times 2, times 4, so this right here is a 16.
Now if I go down by 1/3, that's the same thing as being 2/3 of what I was before. Let me do an example. If I'm at x, and I take away 1/3x, I'm left with 2/3x.
Now that we've got the basics of order of operations out of the way, let's try to tackle a really hairy and beastly problem. So here, we have all sorts of parentheses and numbers flying around. But in any of these order of operations problems, you really just have to take a deep breath and remember, we're going to do parentheses first.
we're used to seeing things from a particular point of view that is from a particular frame of reference and things look different to us under different circumstances at the moment
The midpoint of line segment XY coz it's exactly half way between Now to finish up, we've talked about things that have zero dimensions, points We've talked about things that have one dimension- a line, a line segment or a ray you might say well what has two dimensions?
The 6's cancel out. The right-hand side, 231 minus 6 is 225.
"To a hungry man, a piece of bread is the face of God." Others worry about peace and security, stability in the world.
Then you'd also have to do that with 150, so then it becomes 15,000. Shift it two to the right. So our decimal place becomes like this.
And the reason why we flipped it is so that the liters cancel out, and then we're just left with 10 times 100 is 1,000 centiliters. And we are done!
What is the least common multiple, abbreviated as LCM, of 15, 6 and 10? So the LCM is exactly what the word is saying, it is the least common multiple of these numbers. And I know that probably did not help you much.
6 - 5 is 1, 4 - 1 is 3. The length of this is going to be 31. and it's going to be 31 to the left of 0. This is going to be -31, right over here.
It goes into 4 zero times. So we don't have to worry about that. It goes into 40 eight times.
It's a 90 degree angle, if you've been exposed to the idea of angles already. So you could almost view it as it's 1/2 of this rectangle.
So once again, from 3 to the 0 to 1/3, you're dividing by 3 again. So it really makes sense on some level that 3 to the zeroth power is equal to 1. But that leaves a little bit of a gap.
Well it just looks just like the second term, but we added another column of four blocks here.
It's just got a 1 sitting there. It's not being multiplied by anything.
And we could make it even more interesting, because we know 2 is the exact same thing as 2/1. So 3 divided by 2/1 is equal to 3 times 1/2. Notice we went from a division to a multiplication, and we took the reciprocal.
What fraction of this circle is shaded red ? So you see this circle is divided into one..two..three..four..five ..six.. seven..eight equal parts and of those eight equal parts, seven are shaded red.
You could say 7 + 3 and then multiply that times 5 - and 7+3 is 10. and then you multiply that by 5.
0 multiplied by itself 0 times. And it depends what context you're using. Sometimes people will say that this is undefined, but many more times, at least in my experience, this'll be defined to be 1.
To get 180 from 5, multiple 5 by 36. Have to multiple numerator by same number, 36. So, 144/180.
So 89.3 repeating. So no matter how hard I try in this class, the best I can do. Because I only have two exams left, even if I were to get 100 on the next two exams.
What I had done is I had tuned out of cancer and tuned into my dance. Yes, cancer has just been one page in my life.
In which case, if you're starting with 0.2 and you move the decimal space two to the left, you go bam. Whoops! Bam, bam.
One-third 'x' plus 'b', 'b' is negative two-thirds... ...so I can just write negative 2 over 3. And we are done.
What if I were to ask you what 6 to the third times 6 to the sixth power is? And this is going to be a really huge number, but I want to write it as a power of 6. Let me write the 6 to the sixth in a different color.
So you could say, oh, it's forty. So g would be equal to five. That's how you would solve it in your head.
Now, 343 might not jump out at you as a number that is easy to factor. It's clearly an odd number, so it won't be divisible by 2. Its digits add up to 10, which is not divisible by 3.
And that's equal to how far Jessica is from school, or Jessica's house is from school. So this right over here is equal to 15, which is the same thing as j. So how would you figure it out?
12 less than 8 is negative 4. And you can do that on a number line, if you don't quite remember how to do this. But if you, you know if you take 8 away from 8, you're at 0, and then you take another one, you're at negative 1, then negative 2, negative 3, all the way to negative 4.
If I add more digits here- 999, 9999-- they're all divisible by 3
Part I. 11 divided by negative x/4. Once again, this is the same thing as 11 times the inverse of this. The multiplicative inverse of it, times negative 4/x.
Seven squared is forty-nine. And then ten times negative four, remember order of operations. Multiplication comes before addition so we have to multiply this.
(Laughter) A friend of mine once said, "A three year-old is not half a six year-old."
When 72.1 is multiplied by 10 to the third, the decimal point moves blank places to the blank. And in the exercise, you might see a dropdown here. So remember, if you're multiplying by-- and this is essentially 10 to the third, so you're multiplying by 1,000, you're going to get a larger number.
Well, dividing by 2 is the same thing as multiplying by one half. So we could say that this is 1 times one half times, let me just do it in one color, it's gonna take, so 1 times one half times one half times one half times one half.
Make a table and solve. A biologist is researching the impact of three different water-based sugar drinks on bees ability to make honey.
-16 - 2 = -18, and then that is equal to x over 4 (X/4) -- x over 4 and then we have +2 -2, which is just going to be zero, so we don't even have to write that. I could write just a "+0", but I think that is just a little unnecessary. And so we have -18 = X/4. ... and our whole goal here is to isolate the X... to solve for the "X" and the best way we could do that is we have X/4 over here -- If we multiply that by 4, we're just going to have an "X".
That was the whole point by subtracting negative 6x. And then we have just a negative 26, or minus 26, depending on how you want to view it, so negative 13x is equal to negative 26.
0.2 goes into 4-- I'm going to put a decimal point here.
9 minus 4 is 5. Let me do that in a different color.
9 is the same thing as 3 times 3. We could just cancel these 3's out, or you could imagine this is the same thing as dividing both the numerator and the denominator by 3, or multiplying both the numerator and the denominator by 1/3. These are all equivalent.
This is the income distribution of the United States, 1970. Almost no overlap. And what has happened?
5 times 7. So these are all equivalent, and since we've worked with it so much, let's just figure out the answer. So if we add up 5 to itself seven times, what do we get?
We're starting with 50 ounces of a 25% saline solution. So this is what we start with. Starting solution, we have 50 ounces of it, so
You're going to end up with 20 plus 8s minus C. So you're not going to get rid of the C, you're still going to have two unknowns. He's like, no, no, no Sal. You don't get it.
"You've achieved nothing -- commit. (Laughter) Spent the first six months breastfeeding, I can see."
And I learned to be efficient from this book.["Cheaper by the Dozen"]
So let's just call that x. So that's right over here.
I'm out. Demitry, What did you got? Full house.
Let's say three is nine percent of what?
A standard elevator in a mid-rise building can hold a maximum weight of 1 and 1/2 tons. Assuming an average adult weight of 160 pounds, what is the maximum number of adults who could safely ride the elevator?
If the 3 was a negative number, if I multiplied both sides by negative 3, or negative 1, or negative whatever, I would have had to swap the inequality sign. Anyway, let's simplify this. So the left-hand side, we have 3 times 2/3, which is just 2.
So 16 minus 7 is 9 So now, 96,352 And once again it looks like the 873 is about the closest we can get
Imagine two people who share an important secret have to split up.
It is not a whole number it is not an integer.is it a rational number sure it is as 1 and 3 are integers. so 1/3 is a rational number.if something is rational it cannot be irrational and it is also a real number
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten. Well, if we do what we did in the last video, this 3 cancels with that 3. Those 3's cancel.
We know all the sides are equal. Well, it's a special case of a rectangle where we would multiply the length times the width. We know that they're the same thing.
But zero to the zero, that's a little bit of a question mark.
Now, we just multiply both sides of this equation by 1 over 10, or the reciprocal of 10, which is the coefficient on x, times 1 over 10. You could also, some people would say, well, we're just dividing both side by 10 which is essential what we're doing.
So our slope, which is change in y over change in x, is the rate of change of your vertical axis with respect to your horizontal axis, is going to be equal to 2 over 5, or 2/5. Which if you wrote it as a decimal is equal to 0.4. So this right over here is your slope.
6 times 8 is 48, plus 3 is 51. So it's 512. Now, what is the volume when x is equal to 3?
Well, 2 times 2 times 3 is 12.
If up here, instead of shading in 1 out of the 5 equal sections, if I shaded in 2 of the 5 equal sections, then I wouldn't say this is 1/5 any more. I would say that this 2/5.
And the love ...?
That when people began to cross oceans, in large numbers, the genetic and cultural differences between people from different continents also began to fade, though not disappear.
It will happen again.
You leave the 5 in the radical. So let's do part D. We have to do the square root of 200.
So 4 and 1/2 yards is the same thing as-- let me write it over here-- 9/2. yards. Now, we want to convert this into inches. Just so we can take this in baby steps, maybe we convert this into feet first, and then once we have it in feet, then we can convert it into inches.
(Applause) AG: Many of you might not realize and believe that we have sold this product internationally -- what I call a G2G model, grassroots to global.
So we're going to have a negative 9x, and then we have a negative 3, so minus 3 right here. That's the negative 9 plus the 6, and that is equal to 12x plus 18.
I think that's fair to say, it's almost everyone in the hall. Thank you very much.
The circle is arguably the most fundamental shape in our universe, whether you look at the shapes of orbits of planets, whether you look at wheels, whether you look at things on kind of a molecular level.
What's x plus 2 going to be equal to? Well, that's going to be 2 more, 77.
And what if I had -- let me think -- 9 times negative 5.
What does that mean? These are educated young girls!
You get a 1, 00, 9.1 is 10, 1 plus 1 plus 1 is 3, we have our decimal sign, and we got 3.0001. That's a good review of subtracting decimals. All right.
If you can find anything other than 1 or 51 that is divisible into 51. It seems like... wow this is kind of a strange number You might be tempted to think it's prime, but I'm now going to give you the answer.
6 years ago he was 3, and he is 3 times as old as that. Right, 6 years ago he was 3, and at 9 years old he is 3 times as old as he was 6 years ago. So it definitely works out.
So 8 squared is 64. And we're going to take that to the 1/3 power. Down here, we have 8 to the 1/3.
Okay. He figured out the system. (Music) (Laughter) (Applause) (Music)
Then they find out that the diameter is roughly 2 centimeters.
I could also say five times one fifth is equal to one these are all really saying the same thing Maybe what's kind of interesting here (although it's not some huge learning) it's really just another way of writing what you already probably know, is this idea that if I have a number and I multiply times it's multiplicative inverse (and most of the time when people talk about inverses in mathematics they are talking about the multiplicative inverse) then I'm going to get one so five time one fifth is equal to one but that's just because five times one fifth is the same thing as five divided by five if you were to actually multiply this out you actually take five times one fifth this is equal to five-over-one times one-over-five you multiply the numerators: five times one is five multiply the denominators: one times five is five so you have five fifths, and five fifths is the exact same thing as one
(Laughter) And that's a quite clever guy, huh?
54 times 18.
It just so happened that the Civil Rights Movement was the perfect thing to help him bring his cause to life. We followed, not for him, but for ourselves. By the way, he gave the "I have a dream" speech, not the "I have a plan" speech.
10 - 3 which is 7. And we get the exact same result: question mark is equal to seven. And if we're doing it in kg then this is seven kg.
Can you please say something?
So the area of this triangle is exactly 1/2 of the area of that rectangle. Now, the perimeter of this triangle becomes a little bit more complicated because figuring out this distance isn't the easiest thing in the world.
So, LCM is going to be equal to 33225 =180
103 minus 100 is going to be 3, and now we can bring down this 0. So we bring down that 0 there.
0.25 times some number is equal to 150. Now there's two ways we can do this. We can divide both sides of this equation by 0.25, or if you recognize that four quarters make a dollar, you could say, let's multiply both sides of this equation by 4.
So Joelle has colored in 4, has colored in 4 out of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. 4 out of 7. So it's not clear to me that we can somehow multiply or divide the numerator and the denominator here-- remember it has to be by the same number in order to not change the value of the fraction-- to somehow make that equal to 4/6.
We could say that's two hundreds plus eight tens. And that's exactly what we wrote right here. Notice: this column-- I'm sorry, this diagonal right here,
solve for x. we have x-8=x/3 +1/6. Now the first thing I want to do here There is multiple ways to do this problem,
3 times 2 is 6, or you can view it as 30 times 2 is 60. Add them together.
What is 6 if I have 16 as a denominator?
Add and simplify the answer and write as a mixed number. So we have two mixed numbers here.
I was like, "Let me think about this for a second." I tried to call deep on my courage. And I thought, you know, I am a storyteller.
Two times nine times ten times one hundred times one thousand times one million. But I'm going to stop at twelve because that tends to be what people need to memorize. But if you really want to be a "mathelete" you want to go up to twenty.
We can't add the "21y" to the "-35" or the "-20", because these are adding different things or subtracting different things. But we do have two things that are multiplying "y". We have the...
But instead of a b there we are now going to substitute it with b is equal to negative four. So ten times negative four instead of the b right over there. And then we have the minus eight.
15+46+29 is equal to...let's see. 5+6 is 11. 11+9 is 20.
Well 5 × 2 is the same thing as 2+ 2 + 2 + 2 + 2. You have 5 2's added together. So this is going to be equal to - (Let me write this down.) 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2, which is equal to 2, 4, 6, 8, 10.
'I don't want to go out, because I don't want to scare them.'
Well actually maybe you don't know what an angle is. If I have two lines... and they intersect at some point, the angle is a measure of exactly how wide the intersection is between those two lines.
I have this rectangle here and I want to figure out its area. I want to figure out how much space it is taking up on my screen, right over here. And I encourage you to pause this video and try to figure out the area of this entire rectangle.
(65%.) And just a reminder: "Percent" literally means "per hundred."
It's in the hundreds place. If there was a 4 here, that would mean we're dealing with 4 hundreds. If there's a 5, 5 hundreds.
So we're going to have 2 times this whole expression, 3 plus 1, so it's 2 times 4. That right there is 4.
So notice, when we multiplied seven times seventy-seven we got five hundred thirty-nine. When we multiplied seventy times seventy-seven we got five thousand three hundred ninety. And it makes sense.
Nobody ever sits down and tells you, "This is how it works." So today I'm going to tell you ten things that you thought everybody knew, but it turns out they don't. First of all, on the web, if you want to scroll down, don't pick up the mouse and use the scroll bar.
2,137 square feet.
That complete tells us that they want a whole number of laps. We can't just divide this. If we divide this, we're going to get some 11 point something, something.
So 3 times x plus 1 is the same thing as 3 times x plus 3 times 1 so it's going to be 3x plus 3 times 1 is 3.
And if you're unsure whether eighteen is divisible by nine, you can apply the same rule again. One plus eight is equal to nine. So that's definitely (repeated) by nine.
So, I'll start with this: a couple years ago, an event planner called me because I was going to do a speaking event. And she called, and she said,
Well, if I want to multiply it by 2 zero times, that means I'm just left with the 1. So 2 to the zero power is going to be equal to 1. And, actually, any non-zero number to the 0 power is 1 by that same rationale.
It goes into 82 five times.
So let's see, 16 times 2 is 32, not there yet. Times 3, 48. That seems to work.
What the point here really is is that we can do things with the social environment. This is now taking data from everybody -- from the entire collective memory, visually, of what the Earth looks like -- and link all of that together. Those photos become linked, and they make something emergent that's greater than the sum of the parts.
20 is definitely divisible by 4, so 120 will be divisible by 4.
Once again, not obvious that I can multiply both the numerator and the denominator 3/5 times something to get you to 4/6, so these aren't equivalent. And then Kate has colored in, Kate has colored in 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.
So you get 90. So this entire length here is 90. If you add up the arrows, you get a 90.
So we have this line segment; JL here and we have point
So, 13 out of 20 is going to be equal to what over - is going to be equal to what over 100?
Fill in the table with whole numbers to write 20.1 in different ways. So here, the table, the two columns are tens and tenths. So I guess the assumption is, is we're not going to give anything to the ones place here.
And they write this is the center, of course, is o. They're saying that this right here is x. They say that this right here is y.
So...2...3...4...5...6...7...and 8 So, she wants to put the exact same amount of fluid in each of these 8
Well I wrote it over here.
1 is a factor. That's its actual smallest factor, and its largest factor is 120.
It's a little less than 30.
Each of these cells has their own nucleus and they're actually selective cells that can aid in the absorption of all of the important nutrients in the small intestine. These guys are called enterosites.
40.5 plus 29.5, that indeed is 70. And the difference between the two is indeed 11. They're exactly 11 apart.
My desperation made me an innovator.
1200 square meters. Now let's think about what the area of the plotted Fibonacci drive is. So its length is 20.
5 goes into 5 one time. Right, 81 times.
This quantity right here has to be between negative 2 and 1/2. It has to be greater than negative 2 and 1/2 right there. And it has to be less than 2 and 1/2, so that's all I wrote there.
The problem is -- and I learned this from the research -- that you cannot selectively numb emotion. You can't say, here's the bad stuff. Here's vulnerability, here's grief, here's shame, here's fear, here's disappointment.
The simple way to think about divisibility by 6 is that you have to be divisible by both 2 and 3, to be divisible by 6, because the prime factorization of 6 is 2 times 3. So here we're divisible by 2 and 3, so we're going to be divisible by 6. Here we're divisible by 2 and 3, so we're divisible by 6!
That's a 3 minus 3. The left-hand side, the 3s cancel out, that's why we subtract it in the first place. And you have 10x equals and then minus 5 minus 3, well that equals minus 8.
For the case of the problem, 24,259, the nearest hundred is 24,300.
Not too bad. All I did is add these up and say for every seventeen animals, I've got five chickens.
Just tap the SETTlNGS gear... and select "Edit Profile"
So I'm going to say CBA because I went the double magenta then pink then the last one.
So it's 3x is going to be-- let me write the equality sign right under it-- is equal to-- or you could either just do it mathematically. Say, OK, 17 minus 5. 17 minus 5 is 12.
So I have the numbers 0, 1, 2, 3, 4-- we could even throw 5 in there, although 5 has a frequency of 0. And we have a 6. So the 0 showed up four times in this data set.
(Laughter) He said this in December 1862 to the second annual meeting of Congress. I ought to explain that I have no idea what was happening at the time.
5 minus 3 is 2. And then I have the minus 2 is equal to 1. And now, I like to get into the form where I have 2x, or I have something times x is equal to something.
3 times the t we got, negative 2/3, plus 4 times the g we got, so plus 4 times 2. Let's see what that is.
Put 0 is going to be right over there. and -46 is going to be someplace over here. Notice the same exact idea
(Music) (Video) Narrator: On this planet, 1.6 billion people don't have access to electricity, refrigeration or stored fuels.
And the pattern you might be seeing is if you take negative 1 to an odd power you're going to get negative 1. And if you take it to an even power, you're going to get 1 because a negative times a negative is going to be the positive. And you're going to have an even number of negatives, so that you're always going to have negative times negatives.
So that gets us to 40. Let me do that one more time.
So remember, all you have to say is, well, some number times 1.25-- because I'm growing it by 25%-- is equal to 100. Don't worry, if you're still confused, I'm going to add at least one more presentation on a couple of more examples like this.
And when I measure the diameter of the circle, it's roughly equal to 1. OK, that's interesting. Maybe the ratio of the circumference of the diameter's 3.
One times nine is nine. So this equals minus four minus nine over thirty-six, which equals minus thirteen over thirty-six. I think that's all I have time for right now.
We're asked to round 152, 137, 245, and 354 to the nearest 100, which is another way of saying round each of these numbers to the nearest multiple of 100. So let's think about them one by one. So let's draw a number line here.
So this is just going to be, let's see, 2/3 is the same thing as 10/15. That's 2/3 minus 1/5. The same thing as 3/15 x.
So we could write it like this. x has to be greater than or equal to negative 1, so that would be the lower bound on our interval, and it has to be less than 2 and 4/5.
Now we have 2 hours, which is 120 minutes.
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12. That's what's subtraction is. It's just taking away five things.
9 goes into 80 eight times.
And regardless of whether "a" is less than 0 or not, it prints "we are done with the program".
So we have 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9. So it matches up. We figure out how many square meters can we cover this thing with, without overlapping, without going over the boundaries.
-9b and -9c, and I think you see what's emerging. And then let's work on the xs and the ys. And then we have -7x, and then we have a -7y
And the reason why I'm saying minus three minus two-fifths as this is the same thing as minus three plus two-fifths.
So the average is equal to 84. So depending on what school you go to that's either a B or a C. So, so far my average after the first four exams is an 84.
They fully embraced vulnerability.
You subtract: 4-3 is 1
Let's start again with a point let's call that point, "Point A." And what I'm curious about is all of the points on my screen that are exactly 2cm away from "Point A." So 2cm on my screen is about that far.
What is twelve divided by three? Let me do a new color.
So what's negative one ninth where we change the denominator from nine to thirty-six?
Let's do another one. Let's do one more. I think that's all I have time for.
All right, we're on problem 44.
Many times I go around the world to speak, and people ask me questions about the challenges, my moments, some of my regrets.
This is the income distribution of China, 1970.
Well, at the y-intercept x is going to be equal to 0. So this is the point 0 comma something. And so when people are talking about, what is your y-intercept?
In this video, I want to do a bunch of examples involving exponent properties. But, before I even do that, let's have a little bit of a review of what an exponent even is.
I mean, there is a major climate crisis, obviously, and I think if people don't believe it, they should get out more. (Laughter) But I believe there is a second climate crisis, which is as severe, which has the same origins, and that we have to deal with with the same urgency.
I'm a designer and an educator. I'm a multitasking person, and I push my students to fly through a very creative, multitasking design process. But how efficient is, really, this multitasking?
[Ben] That's right, those are factors. [Sal] and I dont have to write them in any special order?
Welcome to the presentation on adding and subtracting fractions. Let's get started. Let's start with what I hope shouldn't confuse you too much.
But by 200,000 years ago, we're on firmer ground. We find the bones of people in Africa, who looked something like us, not exactly like us, but close.
-1.2: once again, once again it's not a whole number or a negative natural number - I guess it's one way to think about it. 0 is included in the set of integers, so I'll stick that there.
C in terms of F. Now we want to solve for F in terms of C. So let's see how we're going to do that.
93 goes into 770? Let's see. It will go into it, I think, roughly eight times.
And let's see. twenty-eight times four is eighty plus thirty-two. Yep, exactly. He'll be one hundred and twelve.
The same is the situation from the other side: the other person thinks you have been cheating him, pretending to be an emperor and you are just a beggar. When both beggars find that they are beggars, what else can they do other than be angry, enraged,
And we are going to get our number is equal to 150 times 4. Or equal to 600.
"-2" times "4" is "-8", so it's going to be "-8y". So, let's write a "-8y" right over here. And now we're done simplifying.
We have D,C is equal to A,B. And then both of these triangles share this third side right over here. They both share A,C.
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 equal sections. And how many of them have been colored blue? Well, let's see.
Miranda's Maid Service charges $280 to clean 8 offices. What is the company's price for cleaning a single office?
X two, and let's call this, let's call this y two. So this is point x one, y one, this is point x two, y two.
So 49 times 12-- 2 times 9 is 18, 2 times 4 is 8, plus 1 is 9. Put a 0.
The non-zero whole numbers that are divisible into 2 1 × 2 definitely works, 1 and 2, but there really aren't any others that are divisible into 2. So it has only 2 factors, 1 and itself. That's a definition of a prime number.
Arithmetic was really just computation. Now, in geometry, (and what we'll be doing is Euclidean geometry) this is really what math is about.
Let's do a few more problems that bring together the concepts that we learned in the last two videos. So let's say we have the inequality 4x plus 3 is less than negative 1.
LG: You're welcome.
You might sometimes immediately see someone go to 13 times x is equal to 5 times 6. And it might look like magic. How does that work out?
3 times 3 is 9.
And then we'll use m is equal to the number of texts by his mother.
It starts in "X" and keeps going in the direction of "y" for ever, it crosses "y" and keeps going further we need the second point to specify the direction in which the ray is going.
Bring down the next zero. And of course, the decimal is sitting right here, so we want to put it right over there. So you bring down the next zero.
in their moving frame of reference i think you can see but the problem all as a political straight line it looks exactly the same as the day before when doctor whom did the experiment with the car etc if we were moving along in this frame of reference and we couldn't see the surroundings then we wouldn't be able to tell by this experiment that we were moving at a constant velocity as a matter of fact we wouldn't be able to tell by any experiment that we were moving at a constant velocity i'm gonna do the experiment once more and this time i'm not going to stand here behind the ball at the fall so that you won't have any fixed repertoire
So we have 20 minus 7 times x-- x is 2-- minus 7 times 2 is equal to 6 times x-- we've solved for x, it is 2-- minus 6. So let's verify that this left-hand side really does equal this right-hand side. So the left-hand side simplifies to 20 minus 7 times 2, which is 14.
And we have sold ourselves into a fast-food model of education, and it's impoverishing our spirit and our energies as much as fast food is depleting our physical bodies. (Applause) We have to recognize a couple of things here.
29 is pretty close to 30. Those are literally the nearest multiples of ten that I can figure out, so now I can multiply.
So we're starting at negative 2 and we're going to add 3, so we're going to go 3 to the right now.
So this 1 right over here, it is in the tenths place. So it literally represents 1 times 1/10, which is obviously the same thing as 1/10.
[counts to 14] Fourteen blocks, each has a mass of 1 kg, so the total mass will be 14 kg. And we see that the scale is balanced, not tilting down or upwards.
7 times 4 is 28, plus 4 is 32.
Negative 1/2, that is the slope. Where is the y-intercept? That's the y-intercept.
So we go to -6, we go 6 below 0. Let me do one more example. (and this will be a little less conventional but hopefully it will make sense).
8 is a member of all of them.
E is equal to 22/67 times Nevis. Times the same Ben Nevis, right there. And they're telling us more.
Negative 21x minus 3 is equal to-- 12x minus 12x, well, that's just nothing. That's 0. So I could write a 0 here, but I don't have to write anything.
Solve for a and check your solution. And, we have a plus 5 is equal to 54. Now, all this is saying is that we have some number, some variable a, and if I add 5 to it, I will get 54.
68 goes into 20 zero times. And the problem's going to keep going on, but I think we've already once again, gotten to enough accuracy that we can compare. So 1 and 7/68 we've now figured out is equal to 1.10 and if we kept dividing we'll keep getting more decimals of accuracy, but I think we're now ready to compare.
If we were to divide 59.2 by 100, what would we get?
Everything up here is larger than everything there, so ten minus eight is two, eight minus zero is eight, we have our decimal.
Mont Blanc is 4,800. meters high. So B is equal to 4,800. And they ask us, how high is Mount Yukon?
29.12 is the same thing as 2.912 times 10. And now, this is in scientific notation, but that's just this part. We still have to multiply it by another 10.
(Laughter) There's a saying that whatever true thing you can say about India, the opposite is also true.
Well, 12 years ago, if he's 24 now, Ben was 12.
10,000 - Each time you divide by 10, you'd go one step to the left - which, hopefully, makes sense.
So then we'll get 10 * 9/2 = n, is going to be equal to this denominator. And so this is the same thing as saying 10*9 / 2, divide the numerator and denominator by 2, you get 5/1 which is 45.
2 times minus 3-- let me do it in a different color-- 2 times negative 3 is negative 6, plus 3 times 2.
I literally write "2 x 3" But now that we are starting to use variables, if I want to write "2 times x" Well if I use this as the multiplication symbol it would be 2 times x
Now let's do the test for 9.
We're asked to write 7/8 as a decimal and as a percent. We'll start off with a decimal, and we'll see it's pretty easy to go from a decimal to a percent. Now, whenever you see a problem like this, it's sometimes confusing.
And then 7 and 7/12, if we write it as an improper fraction, so we're still going to have the minus sign out there, the denominator is 12.
10 to the fifth times 10 to the negative 5 is 1. So this right here is essentially going to move the decimal 5 to the right.
5's another one of those prime factors, so it's got to have a 5 in there. It didn't already have a 5. And then it also has to have a 3 and a 5.
When they got better tape measures, they measured hey, my diameter's definitely 1. They say my diameter's definitely 1, but when I measure my circumference a little bit, I realize it's closer to 3.1.
Is greater than 3. No we can subtract 7 from both sides to get rid of this positive 7 right over here.
It relates to the number 100. So it's per 100. So you could say, well, this is going to be equal to question mark over 100, the part of 100.
30 goes into 280 about nine times. It's going to be between 7 and 9, so let's try 8.
And multiplication, we can multiply the 2 times the 1/5 first and then multiply by the 3, or we can multiply the 3 times the 2 first and then multiply by the 1/5. So you could view this literally as being equal to 3 times 2 is, of course, 6, so this is the same thing as 6 times 1/5. And if we were to try to visualize that again, so that's a whole.
We've learned a lot about derivatives, and now we will use them to solve something that is hopefully may be kind of useful.
So all of these are true statements here, and these come out of the fact that the angle formed between DB and BC that is a 90 degree angle.
Well, 6 times 11 is 66 and then it's a negative and negative, it's a positive. Let me give you a trick problem.
Let's do some examples comparing absolute values. So, let's say we were to ask ourselves how -9, the absolute value of -9 I should say, how that compares to the absolute value of -let me think of a good number--the absolute value of -7.
You divide by 1000, you get 0.0104, so that's just 10.4 divided by 1000. And then our units are kilometers, kilometers per second. So that's the kilometers And then I have my seconds right over here.
And so negative twenty-one (-21) divided by negative one (-1), negative divided by a negative is going to be a positive. So this is going to be a positive twenty-one (21). Let me write all these things down.
And we have to remind ourselves that one yard is equal to 3 feet. So just so we make sure we don't make that careless mistake, let's put all of our information in yards right now.
Now, I won't go into all of the detail why we believe that there was a Pangaea about 250 million years ago, or this diagram tells us, about 225 million year ago, give or take. But I'll go into some of the interesting evidence. On a very high level, you have a lot of rock commonalities between things that would have had to combine during Pangaea.
So then you'd have forty girls. And you have twenty boys.
But 6 goes into 53, 8 times.
what i want to do with this video is think about the relationship between variables and then think about what the graph of that relationship should look like. So let's say these two axis, the horizontal axis over here I plot the price of a product and lets say this vertical axis over here i plot the demand for the product, and i'm only plotting the first quadrant here because i'm assuming that the price can only be positive and i'm assuming that the demand can only be positive, that people aren't going to pay someone to take the product away from them. So let's think about what would happen for the price and demand for most normal products.
So that's minus 9 over 3.
So let's do this first one: part A.
8 units times 8 units is 64 square units. And what is the perimeter here? What is the perimeter?
8/0 is undefined. So in this situation the slope is undefined. When you have a vertical line, you say your slope is undefined.
Fourteen weeks on the Best Seller list, eight printings, and still going strong. So even though we love publishing as an art, we very much know it's a business too, and that if we do our jobs right and get a little lucky, that great art can be great business. So that's my story.
So once again,one times anything is going to be that anything. This is going to become 0
A man is just like a well .... Source: 'From Darkness to Light # 22' Copyright © Osho International Foundation, Switzerland.
100 times 10 is 1,000.
What is the y-value when x equals 0? Well, let's see.
Well the least common multiple of nine and four is thirty-six. So that's equal to thirty-six.
6 times 2 is 12. Subtract. You get 0.
If you divide 4 by 2, you get 2, so this is equal to 3/2. So it's still written as an improper fraction. We now have to write it as a mixed a number.
If you're lucky and that doesn't happen, then the food that couldn't be either digested or absorbed passes into this ascending colon and slowly moves up through the transverse colon and down the descending colon. As it's kind of progressively dried and stored. Then once it enters the sigmoid colon then a bowel movement is triggered and feces are secreted through the anus.
You can do the 12 times 3 first or you can do the 3 times 10 first. Either way, they both evaluated to 360.
Well to go from four to thirty-six, we have to multiply this fraction by nine, or we have to multiply the denominator by nine, so you also have to multiply the numerator by nine.
We're asked how many inches are in 4 and 1/2 yards? Let me write that down.
Minus six and eleven. ten to the fifth power.
So we could write 4,500 is equal to 3 thousands plus-- now we have to just write this in terms of hundreds. Well, This is 15 hundreds.
We can subtract 15 from both sides. And I like to switch up my notation.
What I want to do in this video is to expose you and introduce you to the idea to what a computer program is. And just in case you want to follow along I highly recommend you do that because the real way to learn computer science is to really fiddle with things yourself.
So what is 20 times 20? Well, this is going to be 400.
It is also divisible by 3; 3 × 8 = 24. And at this point, we don't actually have to find all of the factors to realize that it's not prime. It clearly has more factors than just 1 and itself.
If we start at -1 and we subtract 2, we should get -3. Kind of reverses this thing up here.
Negative 2 plus 6 is plus 4. So there you have it, that is our slope intercept form, mx plus b, that's our y-intercept.
If you add these two things, we'll have 36, because we're considering kind of parts of 36 or fractions of 36, and then we have 16 plus 33 in the numerator.
We can write negative 5 and 4/9 kilometers is greater than negative 8 kilometers. And so if we're thinking about which point is deeper, it's going to be the one that's more negative, because that tells us how far below sea level we are. So the negative 8 kilometer point is further below sea level.
Let's think about whether is 2 divisible into 120?
2 times 2.5 is 5. And then 10 to the negative 2 times 10 to the ninth, when you multiply two numbers that are being raised to exponents and have the exact same base-- so it's 10 to the negative 2 times 10 to the negative 9-- we can add the exponents. So this is going to be 10 to the 9 minus 2, or 10 to the seventh.
Monday, 10.21; Tuesday, 3.35.
So the absolute value of 5 is 5.
They are narrower, so we are going to see that they are smaller than right angles.
8 is divisible by both 8 and 4, so that is the least common multiple of 4 and 8, so our common denominator will be 8.
12 times 2 is 24.
This is Salman Khan from the Khan Academy For CNBC.
I could have written this as, this is the same thing as 2 times 5 squared. And if you look at the order of operations, exponents take priority over multiplication. That's why in my head I just automatically put those parentheses.
Maybe ten to the fifth.
Negative 4 over negative 6. If I viewed this as my starting point, I could say that I went up 4, so it would be a change in y would be 4, and then my change in x would be 6. And either way, once again, change in y over change in x is going to be 4 over 6, 2/3.
Negative 13 times x divided by negative 13, that's just going to be x. You multiply something times x, divide it by the something, you're just going to be left with an x. So the left-hand side just becomes an x. x is equal to negative 26 divided by negative 13.
2 times 6 is 12. She gets 12 from breaking.
Well, 150%, percent literally means per cent, per hundred. So this is plus 150 per 100. So now we've written them all as fractions.
And I'm going to add some girls to the classroom.
28 minus 11-- 28 minus 10 would be 18, so this is going to be 17. It's going to be 17 plus 44. And then 17 plus 44-- I'll scroll down a little bit.
Ten, ten x is equal to seven point seven repeating. Which is equal to seven point seven seven seven on and on forever. As we established earlier that x is equal to zero point seven repeating; which is equal to seven point seven seven seven on and on and on forever.
What if I said minus 2 times minus 7. And you might want to pause the video at any time to see if you know how to do it and then restart it to see what the answer is.
So if I'm multiplying something by 0.15 and then I divided by 0.15, I'll just be left with an x here. That's the whole motivation. If I do it to the left-hand side, I have to do it to the right-hand side.
And let's just assume that we only know the stuff right over here, or we can multiply 16 times a multiple of 10. So 800 would once again be too big. Let's just go with 320 right over here.
That was the whole point behind multiplying this first character by 2, so that the 3t becomes a 6t, and we're left with 8g plus g is 9g, is equal to 12 plus 6, which is 18. Divide both sides by 9, and you are left with g is equal to 18/9, or 2. So we've solved for g.
So 1.5 squared is 2.25. And 2.25 times 6-- so let me just multiply that out. 2.25 times 6.
What if it was 4 times 5 to the third power? Well, that would just be equal to 4 times 5 times 4 times 5 times 4 times 5, right, which is the same thing as 4 times 4 times 4 times 5 times 5 times 5, right? I just switched the order in which I'm multiplying, which you can do with multiplication.
So, if you subtract thirty-five from both sides, you get g is equal to five. So if you add five girls to your classroom, you're going to have forty girls.
And then to make sure we are divisible by 10, we need to have at least one 2 and one 5. These two over here make sure we are divisible by 10. and so we have all of them, this 2 x 3 x 5 has all of the prime factors of either 10, 6 or 15, so it is the LCM. So if we multiply this out, you will get, 2 x 3 is 6, 6 x 5 is 30.
And 3/20, well we could figure out what that is going to be.
But what about 1,500 calories?
In order to be composite you have to have more than two factors: 1, yourself, and some other things.
So I have this yellow rectangle here and we know two things about this yellow rectangle. We know that it has a length of 10, that the, that the length of this side right over here is 10, and we also know that this yellow rectangle has an area of 60 square units. Whatever units we're measuring this 10 in.
So eighteen divided by six is $three. That's $three per guava at full price. And they're asking us, we want two guavas.
This 3 is in the ten thousandths place. So the 3 is in the ten thousandths place. So you could literally view this as 9/1,000 plus 3/10,000.
So b is 12 times the square root of 3. Hopefully you found that useful.
So lets try, lets try, 6.7. Let's try 6.7 and the really way to try it is to square 6.7.
Plus negative two. which would be equal to-- well, negative two plus negative two is negative four, plus another negative two is negative six. This would be equal to negative six.
Let's say we have 2xy squared times negative x squared y squared times three x squared y squared. And we wanted to simplify this. This you can view as negative 1 times x squared times y squared.
3/5 divided by 1/2 is 1 and 1/5. Now, the one thing that's not obvious is why did this work? Why is dividing by 1/2 the same thing as multiplying essentially by 2.
Nine to eleven, every prisoner went into the education program -- the same den in which they thought they would put me behind the bar and things would be forgotten. We converted this into an ashram -- from a prison to an ashram through education. I think that's the bigger change.
A local hospital is holding a raffle. The individual cost of participating in the raffle is given by the following expression 5t + 3 or 5 * t + 3, where t represents the number of tickets one purchases. evaluate the expression when t = 1, t = 8 &amp; t = 10 Lets first take the situation when t = 1, so the expression becomes 5 * 1 + 3 and we know from order of operations, we do the multiplication before we do the addition. so ( 5 * 1) + 3 = 5 + 3 = 8.
Which is a huge number. If you actually, it's more than the number of atoms, or the estimated number of atoms in the known universe. In the known universe.
Zero degrees would be two lines on top of each other... this if I were to just eyeball it looks like 45 degrees.
"Metry" comes from Greek for "measurement".
(Applause) My name is Aisha Chaudhary and I'm 15 years old.
Based on this, 0 should not work. So what happens if we put 0 here?
What should people here at TED, here in the West, do if they want to connect or make a difference and they believe in what's happening here? I think we have discovered a very important issue in the Arab world -- that people care, people care about this great transformation.
Solve for x and check your solution. We have x divided by 3 is equal to 14. So to solve for x, to figure out what the variable x must be equal to, we really just have to isolate it on the left hand side of this equation
Instead of 13, since I'm about to subtract 26/3 from both sides, let me rewrite 13 as 39/3. right?
(Laughter) Alright what about problems? What about a great depression?
9 times 6 is the exact same thing as 6 times 9, so this thing could be a 9. It could be replaced with a 9. I guess I'm all out of questions.
Let's say I have 2 - 8 (and we'll think about more ways to do this in future videos), but once again, you just want to do the number line. You have a 0 here. We're at (let me draw the spacing a little bit).
So we wrapped this around a blob-like form, which is in the shape of a teddy bear, which was hanging from the ceiling. And the idea was to sort of contrast something very cold and distant and abstract like the universe into the familiar form of a teddy bear, which is very comforting and intimate. And the idea was that at some point you would stop looking at the form of a teddy bear and you would almost perceive it to be a hole in the space, and as if you were looking out into the twinkling night sky.
Is 25 equal to 2 times 16 minus 7?
Well, that's the exact same idea: we will just add the lengths of the sides So, let's say that that these distances in -- let's say they are in meters. So let's say that this is 3 meters, this is also 3 meters -- this is a rectangle here, so this is 5 meters and this is also 5 meters.
We're asked to multiply 1.45 times 10 to the eighth times 9.2 times 10 to the negative 12th times 3.01 times 10 to the negative fifth and express the product in both decimal and scientific notation. So this is 1.45 times 10 to the eighth power times-- and I could just write the parentheses again like this, but I'm just going to write it as another multiplication-- times 9.2 times 10 to the negative 12th and then times 3.01 times 10 to the negative fifth.
2 plus 2 is 4.
And on this side, you had that 7 times 2 plus this thing in orange parentheses there. Now, at any step you just look again. We always want to do parentheses first.
And to figure out what we have to multiply 4 by to get 120, you could do it in your head.
Well, when x is equal to 0, y is equal to 1.
Eight plus eight is sixteen. Sixteen plus eight is twenty-four. So three times eight is twenty-four.
However, if we try to divide 29 into equal pieces, we run into a problem: it is impossible.
So negative 9 minus 12, that's negative 21.
If we're not including 1,500, so we're only less than, we were very explicit that we don't color in the circle. But then we show that, look, we can do everything below that. Now, you're probably saying, OK, Sal, you did less than, you did less than or equal, what if you wanted to do it the other way around?
We said 27 goes into 10 0 times.
I want to make little townhouse shapes with toothpicks. So this would be my first townhouse.
0.05 kilometers is equal to 50 meters. We're not done yet. Now, you need to convert those 50 meters into centimeters.
7 times 7 is 49, so it goes into it seven times.
So this is really a quick way of counting how many of these square meters you have. So you could say that 2 meters multiplied by 3 meters is equal to 6 square meters. Now, you might say, hey, I'm not sure if that always applies.
Minus 1.1 minus Just like that. And we can even add some 0's there, just to make it clear.
I've got three groups of seventeen. So for each of those groups, I have five chickens. three times five is fifteen chicken. You could use the same process to figure out the number sheep or pigs you might have.
And if you subtract 60 from both sides of this equation you get x is equal to 120 degrees.
So 10 divided by 2 is 5, so this will result in 6, plus 10 divided by 2, is 5. 6 plus 5. Well, we still have to evaluate this parentheses, so this results-- what's 6 plus 5?
And we haven't even talked yet about how this was found! Napoleon has his army in Egypt.
5 over 12 times x times 8 over 5 is equal to what?
2 times 1 is 2, and now we can add. And we get 2 plus 0 is 2.
If I change this, and take GDP per capita instead of family income, and I turn these individual data into regional data of gross domestic product, and I take the regions down here, the size of the bubble is still the population. And you have the OECD there, and you have sub-Saharan Africa there, and we take off the Arab states there, coming both from Africa and from Asia, and we put them separately, and we can expand this axis, and I can give it a new dimension here, by adding the social values there, child survival. Now I have money on that axis, and I have the possibility of children to survive there.
9 times 7 is 63. Subtract. We don't have any remainder.
So 1/5 plus 1/5. And if we wanted to visualize it, let me make a hole here and divide it into five equal sections.
Negative 4 plus 6 is 2. So it's 3 times 2, which is also 6. So when x is equal to negative 1, you substitute here, the
We decreased by 20%. Well you're going to be left with 80%. So we could say 80% of the price last year is equal to the price this year.
33 tens is 330. And finally, you could view it as 0 hundreds and 43 tens.
So this symbol right over here, this is saying that C is less than or equal to 1,500 calories. So now 1,500 would be a completely legitimate C, a completely legitimate number of calories to have in a day.
So this whole thing becomes negative 8 over negative 3 plus 8 is 5. So it's negative 8/5, minus 8 over 5. All right, let me clear up some space just so we can reference this problem properly.
We end up with four and twelve divided by three is four.
Sixty-nine percent believe that the Earth is heating up in a significant way. There has been progress, but here is the key: when given a list of challenges to confront, global warming is still listed at near the bottom. What is missing is a sense of urgency.
And 9 is divisible by 3, so 117 is going to be divisible by 3.
(Laughter) I was told that this was no laughing matter. This would be the first time that only women would carry the Olympic flag.
(Laughter) It doesn't create the distortion of reality; it creates the dissolution of reality. In fact, I used to argue with my professor, Richard Evan Shultes -- who is a man who sparked the psychedelic era with his discovery of the magic mushrooms in Mexico in the 1930s --
So then you have 40 divided by 2 minus 5 times 6. So, division - you just have 1 division here - You want to do that.
This goes from 48 pieces to 3 pieces.
And let's say that I were also to tell you that this angle right here is 120 degrees. Now the question I want to ask here is, are these two lines parallel? Is this magenta line and this blue line parallel?
So we want to express 19/27 - which is the same thing as 19 ÷ 27 - as a decimal. So let's divide 27 into 19.
And luckily for me, that home and the love inside of it, along with help from teachers, mentors and friends along the way, was enough. Now, why is this story important? Because from a planning perspective, economic degradation begets environmental degradation, which begets social degradation.
The left-hand side, the 3's cancel out-- that was the whole point behind dividing by 3-- we get just an x is being equal to-- and 225 divided by 3. Let me do it over here.
So let's get a common denominator between 64 and 40.
And just like that, the iceberg shows you a different side of its personality.
And in every one of these columns, so this right here, x minus 1 is the number of columns, and then in each column we have four blocks. So it's the number of columns times 4, right?
Hi Celine. This is Ivan. Remember me?
This is really a two-hour presentation I give to high school students, cut down to three minutes. And it all started one day on a plane, on my way to TED, seven years ago.
Multiply 1 and 3/4 times 7 and 1/5. Simplify your answer and write it as a mixed fraction. So the first thing we want to do is rewrite each of these mixed numbers as improper fractions.
Norman Jewison said to me, "I think it all has to do with focusing yourself on one thing." And push!
G represents the height of the giraffe,
So you divide both of them by 25. So 75 divided by 25 is 3, and 100 divided by 25 is 4. So as a simplified mixed number, this becomes 2 and 3/4.
Let's isolate all of the I terms on one side, and the best way we can do that by leaving it here on the right and then getting rid of this 2w, and the best way to get rid of this 2w is to subtract is from the right and if you're gonna subtract it from the right you also have to subtract it from the left if you want this equality to hold so you have to also subtract if from the left and so the lefthand side becomes p-2w, p-2w and the right hand side you get, this 2w minus 2w, cancels out you just have a 2l.
The absolute value of -7 is equal to 7... that's the length of this arrow. But we're moving it to the left.
Negative, I wanna make my negatives in magenta.
25 goes into 0 zero times.
Negative 4 over 9. I'm giving some space there. Now, we want the x on the right-hand side, so let's add x to both sides of this equation.
(Laughter) So I'm sorry about that. And I'm already off-message.
1 times 21 is 21, and now lets subtract This is a 10, this becomes a 3.
0 minus negative 6. So when your change in x is equal to-- so this will be 6-- what is our change in y? Remember we're taking this as our finishing position.
So 82.5 miles in an hour and a half is also 55 miles per hour. And then finally, if you do 110 miles 2 hours, 110 divided by 2 is 55.
And we can simplify this expression right over here. We have a 9 in the numerator, a 3 in the denominator. If we divide both of them by 3, we get a 3 and a 1.
I guess I'm doing it right now. (Laughter) This is like the failure conference.
9 times 6 is 54. 6 minus is 20 6 goes into-- so we'll see it's actually 89.333333, goes on forever.
Actually, let's do, well, I could write it just like that. Let me try out, make it a table, here. So I have a table, here.
And the reason we were able to do that is because this stone said the same statement three times, in three different languages. So, the three languages are:
But in our answer we don't want to have 3 significant figures. We wanna have the... only as precise as the least precise thing that we added up. The least precise thing we only go one digit behind the decimal over here, so we can only go to the tenth, only one digit over the decimal there.
And this right over here is the frontispiece of the English version--- or the first translation of the English version---of "Euclid's Elements". This was done in 1570. But it was obviously first written in Greek, and, during the Middle Ages, that knowledge was shepherded by the Arabs and it was translated into Arabic.
Man 8: Okay, A12, right there!
0.72, it's not quite 1, but it's getting close to 1, almost 3/4 of a whole, and this is almost 3/4 of 1,000.
So - ahm - the influenza type A is a very large group of viruses, much larger than the type B. And so we need to further divide this group according to subtype and the subtype is named according to surface proteins that are on the outside of every virus. So there are two kinds of surface proteins on every influenza A virus and we call these H for hemagglutinin and N for neuraminidase.
24 squared minus 12 squared is equal to 432. So b is equal to the square root of 432. And let's factor this again.
So 8 clearly belongs to this as well. So let's expand our set a little bit. Let's think about integers.
Oh honey please! You're in the way! Can't I help you, Mom?
If you're here today -- and I'm very happy that you are -- you've all heard about how sustainable development will save us from ourselves. However, when we're not at TED, we are often told that a real sustainability policy agenda is just not feasible, especially in large urban areas like New York City. And that's because most people with decision-making powers, in both the public and the private sector, really don't feel as though they're in danger.
So let's do 1 times 10. And now let's multiply by another 10. Let's multiply by another 10.
So zero divided by anything that's non-zero is just going to equal to zero. But what if it were the other way around? What happens if we said negative five divided by zero?
As an artist, connection is very important to me. Through my work I'm trying to articulate that humans are not separate from nature and that everything is interconnected. I first went to Antarctica almost 10 years ago, where I saw my first icebergs.
What I wanna do in this video is think about the origins of Algebra, the origins of Algebra. And the word especially an association with the ideas that Algebra now represents. comes from, comes from, this book or actually this is a page of the book right over there. The English translation for the title of this book is,
Let's assume these are all equal pieces, and I'm hungry, so I eat this piece and this piece, so they essentially go away. So, what fraction of these pieces have I eaten? Well, I have a total of 5 pieces, and I ate 2 of them, so 2/5 of this bar have been eaten.
(Laughter) There is now a kind of sleep deprivation one-upmanship.
He's going to be twenty-four plus y. So that's, I'll say Jon for short.
Now, use the distributive property, that tells us that this is going to be equal to 5 times 3, which is 15, plus 5 times 7, which is 35.
4 plus 3 plus 1 is 8, so you get 8/8 which is this entire whole. So hopefully that helps give you a visual understanding of what we're doing when we're adding and decomposing these fractions a little bit more.
(Laughter) Then I looked at her and I said something that at the time felt a little dramatic, but ended up being more prophetic than dramatic.
5 times 8 is 40, and you have no remainder. So when you divide 280 by 8, you get 35.
But anyway, we actually answered the question before without even realizing it when we filled in all of these values. What is the y-value when x equals 0?
So 1, 2, 3, 4. And you see that it exactly matches up.
If I were to approximate--let's see that's 100, 110, 120, almost 130--so let's call that maybe a 128 degree angle. We call this an obtuse angle. The way I remember it is acute: it's kind of a cute angle.
"It just is what it is." And I said, "Oh my God, this is going to suck."
What's -3 minus -3 Interesting. Well, the minuses cancel out, so you get -3 plus 3

1 times 4 is 4. You subtract.
So one way of thinking about 30%-- this literally means 30 per 100. So you could view this as 30/100 times 6 is the same thing as 30% of 6.
So 24, let's do its prime factorization. This is 2 times 12.
[Some kids laughing, others expressing satisfaction or frustration.] STUDENT: That one's out!
Now five thousand seven hundred thirty-two times ten is fifty-seven thousand three hundred twenty. I just had to add a zero there, but that was a pretty straightforward multiplication. And notice, we had five thousand times ten and we got to fifty-something thousand when we multiplied them.
I don't know if this 4 o'clock is useful yet. And the husband, he gets there right when she gets there. So he traveled-- he gets there, and I don't know if I'm-- maybe I should draw a more-- well, let me just draw it this way.
And if I start at the number - (Let me draw all of the numbers.) 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. So you could think about this as saying, "Well, we're on the number line.
8 times 9 is 72.
But if we were to do this, we would get x is equal to x, and then we could subtract x from both sides. And then you would get zero equals zero, which is true for any x that you pick.
Then this expression right here would be... 0 plus -3 (because that's our "y" now) plus -7. Now 0 plus or minus anything won't change its value So you can really just ignore the 0 here.
Now, if we take 2/3 of M, that's going to stick us some place around, oh, I don't know, 2/3 is right about there. So this is M-- let me write this-- this is 2/3 M.
AlDS, pneumonia -- I can just see you're getting excited, just at the very name of these things. And the skill sets required to tackle these things are very broad. You know, the system doesn't naturally make it happen.
You can see he's frenetic now. He wants to get out really bad. He wants to go run and play.
So let's do this. seventy-five goes into fifty zero times. seventy-five goes into five hundred-- so let me think about that.
1, 2, 3, 4, 5. So this will be 2.5, and then we're going to be left with times 10 to the negative 5. Anyway, hopefully, you found that scientific notation drill useful.
If you start with 3 x equals 15, then we can say that instead of dividing by 3, I can just see me free to 3 I can stick with the left side only equal to x, if I multiply both sides by the equacao by 1/3 then if I multiply that estimate the equacao on both sides by 1/3 This also works you say, 1/3 of 3 and 1.
And so you would specify line EF you would specify line EF with these arrows just like that Now the thing you're gonna see most typically When we're studying Geometry are these right over here
What I want to do in this video is show you a way of subtracting numbers that is different than the regrouping technique. And this is closer to what I actually do in my head. And this might not be what you see in school, so be careful while you're looking at this.
We have 4,500 equals 3 thousands plus how many hundreds, question mark hundreds? So let's write this left-hand side, but I'm going to write it out in terms of thousands and hundreds.
So let's say that you have x plus seven is equal to ten, and I want to solve for x. All its saying is something plus seven is equal to ten, and you might be able to figure that out in your head, but if you want to do it a little bit more systematically, you're like well just all I want on the left hand side is an x. Well if all I want on the left hand side is an x
There's a little bit of an art to this. Alright, now let's subtract. Once again, we can regroup, this would be a 10, we've taken 10 from essentially this 30, so this becomes a 2 10 minus six is 4 2 minus 2 is zero 1 minus 1 is zero.
12 divided by 3 is 4, but this is going to be 4 times 10, because you have that 10 left over. Whatever works for you. Or you can just ignore the 0, divide by 3, you get a 4, and then put the 0 back there.
So it looks like they're all kind of clumped together if you go back a few hundred million years. And, based on literally just that thought experiment, you can imagine that at one point, all of the continents on the world were kind of merged into one supercontinent. And that supercontinent is called "Pangaea."
If x is equal to, I don't know, -7, (x = -7) then x + 5, is going to be equal to -
In the last video, we talked about how the Serbians were able to hold back the Austro-Hungarians at the beginning of World War I. But eventually they had to give in. They were essentially -
All right.
So now we have 14, and we're trying to think of its multiples. So there's two ways of doing this. You could go number by number and try to divide 14 into them, or we could just try to figure out what all of the multiples of 14 actually are.
Now that we know a little bit about multiplying positive and negative numbers, Let's think about how how we can divide them. Now what you'll see is that it's actually a very similar methodology.
In the ordinary economic world you have to snatch as much from everybody as possible then you have more and more and more.
That gets priority of the addition, so we're going to do that before we do the addition. But how do we evaluate that? Do we do the division first, or the multiplication first?
1 is not greater than 4, so we're going to have to borrow again. Get rid of that. And then this becomes an 11.
So our delta x could be 1. When we move over 1 to the right, what happens to our delta y?
"If 500 turns into 1,000 or 2,000, my life is over."
And then 13.5 minus 22, let me do it over here, 13.5 minus 22. My brain imagines, or the way I process it is, I say, well-- I always like to put the larger number first-- I say that's the negative of 22 minus 13.5.
you look to queue here you're upside down you're the ones upside down no europe turns out well not he's the one that's upside down his name well let's talk for a
To know anything, you have to begin with yourself.
Seven times seven is forty-nine.
I get zero points, and then if I get one question right- and the table tells us that- or we could logically think about it every questions I get right I'm gonna get five more points so if I get one question right I'm gonna get five more points, and we saw that in our table as well. We saw that right over here one question, five points. We could plot it two questions, ten points.
let's, let's, just for fun, let's check this just to see. And the cool thing about algebra is if you have enough time, you can always make sure you got the right answer. So we have 5x, so we have 5 times negative 11 over 3.
So seven goes into twelve one time. one times seven is seven. twelve minus seven is five.
"I'm really struggling with how to write about you on the little flyer." And I thought, "Well, what's the struggle?" And she said, "Well, I saw you speak, and I'm going to call you a researcher, I think, but I'm afraid if I call you a researcher, no one will come, because they'll think you're boring and irrelevant."
While reading the chapter called "The Wanderer" from The Sound of Running Water, I saw that the culminating sentence was, "Yet the call is heard, as somewhere in our being the promise is remembered."
Let's do one more just to tire your brain.
Another way to say it, the ninety-five dollars has grown by fifteen percent. So let's just work this out.
Find the sum of -15.08 + (-131.52) So lets draw a number line here.The point 0 is here and we are going to start with -15 and 8 hundreths and that we are going to add -131.52. we are adding a negative number, we have to move this amount to the left, we are going to move -131 and 52hundreths to the left to give us our answer
Negative 3 is definitely not greater than 0. So that doesn't work out. If she breaks 2 plates, well, 2 plates-- if she breaks 2 plates, 2 times 2, she'll get 4 tokens from breaking the plates, but she still had to use up 5.
So you could completely view this as being equal to-- so you're going to start with a 1, and you're going to multiply 1 times negative 2 three times. So this is times negative 2 times negative 2 times negative 2. So clearly these are the same number.
(Laughter) I had no contingency plan for four million.
Well I have 2 groups of 3. 2 groups of 3. Or another way of thinking about it is this is 3 + 3.
So it's 2/3 is greater than negative 4y minus 25 over 3.
2r minus 13/4 is less than-- 2 times 2 is 4, plus 1 is five-- is less than 5/2. So that's the first equation. And then the second question-- and do the same thing here-- we have 2r minus 13 over 4 has to be a greater than negative 5/2.
1 times 60 is 60. And we subtract. We get 30.
But if you're putting a negative in front of a negative 7, you're going to get x to a seventh. So this thing can simplify to x to the negative 3, times x to the seventh power. And then we can add the exponents, and that is x to the fourth power.
So this is going to be equal to 51.8 divided by 10. The decimal's just going to move to the left. It's going to be 5.18.
Does this actually make sense, that 16 is a much lower number than 400. Well sure it does and actually if you have any experience filling up a car; you would sense that okay, that's about the size, you know, on, on around 16 gallons. You, car tends to go 300 or 400 miles if it, if it gets pretty good fuel mileage.
We're told that for the past few months, Old Maple Farms has grown about 1,000 more apples than their chief rival in the region, River Orchards. Due to cold weather this year, the harvests at both farms were down by about a third.
5 apples-- let me do that same green color. We have 5 apples, and each of those apples are going to cost $0.47. So 5 apples times $0.47 per apple, this will give us the total cost of the 5 apples in cents.
(Laughter) I did that for two reasons. First of all, I wanted to give you a good visual first impression.
And actually, if you think about it, 0.2% is 1/500. And if you do the math, one / five hundred of seven will turn out to be this number. And that's an important thing to do.
Now let's graph this. So I'll make my vertical axis the y-axis, that's inches on the ground. y is equal to inches left on the ground. And then the horizontal axis, that is our x-axis-- let me scroll down a little bit-- this is days after Monday.
Jess recently started a business producing cosmetic products made from natural ingredients. She wants to advertise her products by distributing bags of samples in her neighborhood.
In the United States, 13 out of every 20 cans are recycled.
Now the reason why I say it's special besides the fact that pulmonary arteries and veins go to and from the lungs, is that they're kind of the opposite. Because in the rest of the body when we're going away from the heart or we're talking about arteries, you're going to see that that's oxygenated blood, while when we're going away from the heart to the lungs, that's de-oxygenated blood. Similarly in the rest of the body, when we're going to the heart, where you're to see that that's de-oxygenated blood, but in the pulmonary vein, when we're going to the heart, it's oxygenated because the lungs are what take up the carbon dioxide and give us the oxygen.
different species have different numbers of chromosomes.
All of that over 4 minus 8, that's negative 4. This right here is negative 4. And then minus this negative 2.
1 plus 0 plus 7 is 8, plus 6 is 14.
So what's minus six plus eleven?
A few years ago, I felt like I was stuck in a rut, so I decided to follow in the footsteps of the great American philosopher, Morgan Spurlock, and try something new for 30 days.
6 is 2 times 3. So the square root of 24, this is the same thing as the square root of 2 times 2 times 2 times 3. That's the same thing as 24.
Round 1,585 to the nearest ten. Let me rewrite the number.
Solve for x, and we have the absolute value of 2x minus 5 is equal to 11. Now, the big insight you need to have whenever you have an absolute value equation like this is to remember, if I have the absolute value of a is equal to 11 what do we know about a? That means that a is either equal to 11
Rewrite the expression five times 9 minus 4-- that's in parentheses-- using the distributive law of multiplication over subtraction. Then simplify.
So 300 minutes is how many hours? Well you have 60 minutes per hour so you could say 300 minutes-- I'll just write min for short-- divided by 60 minutes per hour gives us 300 divided by 60 is 5 hours. So it will take Jess and her seven friends, a total of eight people, five hours to prepare all of her sample bags.
So, today who is it going to take to spread the infection from 100,000 children to the 200 million children in India? Last I heard, the preamble still said, "We, the people of India," right? So, if not us, then who?
Let's think about what fraction of this grid is shaded in pink. So the first thing we wanna thing about is how many equal sections do we have here. Well this is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 by 1, 2, 3 grid.
Like Ninja Barbie, but I'm Vulnerability TED -- I thought, I'm going to leave that shame stuff behind, because I spent six years studying shame before I started writing and talking about vulnerability. And I thought, thank God, because shame is this horrible topic, no one wants to talk about it.
Because seven times is going to be too much.
So the answer here is it is in the hundreds place.
13, 14. I could keep on going But maybe 14 will be enough for this video
2 times 5 is 10, and then you subtract, and you have a remainder of 3. So 63/5 is the same thing as 12 wholes and 3 left over, or 3/5 left over.
So the correct answer was minus 11 over 3. Hopefully you're ready by now to, do some level three problems. The only thing that makes this a little bit more complicated than level two is you just have to remember to merge the variables in the beginning, and, know that you could subtract variables or constants from both sides.
100 is divisible by both 10 and 100, so multiply both the numerator and denominator of this character by 10. You get 10 on the top and 100 on the bottom. 1/10 is the same thing as 10 over 100.
So total is equal to 63 plus 18. I had 63 seats, I'm now adding 18 seats.
The square root of the 20 is 4 times 5.
And then 9000 - 8000 is 1000. And we got the same result  because 1000 + 500 + 70 + 8 is 1578.
And you get x is greater than or equal to negative 60 minus 15 is negative 75. If something is greater than or equal to something else, if I take 15 away from this and from that, the greater than or equal sign will still apply.
What they had in common was a sense of courage. And I want to separate courage and bravery for you for a minute. Courage, the original definition of courage, when it first came into the English language -- it's from the Latin word "cor," meaning "heart" -- and the original definition was to tell the story of who you are with your whole heart.
So now we're going to be 10 to the left. We are going to be 10 to left. 10 to the left.
And let's say my other equation in my system is negative 6x plus 14y is equal to negative 2. So, let's try to find the x's and y's that satisfy this equation here. And just for a change of pace, let's do some substitution.
1 over 5 8ths squared, which is going to be the same thing, which is going to be the same thing, so this is going to be equal to, trying to color code it, 1 over 5 8ths times 5 8ths, which is 25 over 60, 25 over 64. 1 over 25 over 64 is just going to be 64 over 25. So a, another way to think about it is, you're going to take the reciprocal of this and raise it, and raise it to the positive exponent.
We have the inequality 2/3 is greater than negative 4y minus 8 and 1/3. Now, the first thing I want to do here, just because mixed numbers bother me-- they're actually hard to deal with mathematically. They're easy to think about-- oh, it's a little bit more than 8.
Minus 16, so she's going to have $4 left in change.
So this is negative 30 plus 7 is negative 23, which is indeed less than negative 20.
Bobby and Petra are running a lemonade stand and they charge $0.45 for each glass of lemonade. In order to break even, they must make $25. How many glasses of lemonade must they sell to break even?
Without understanding the nature of life.
Four point one. And we are done.
We always start with a 1, and we multiply it by the 2 one time.
"Write a mathematical expression which corresponds to x time y minus a times b times c."
And the best way to view it, slope is equal to change in y over change in x. And for a line, this will always be constant. And sometimes you might see it written like this: you might see this triangle, that's a capital delta, that means change in, change in y over change in x.
We have the equation 3/4x plus 2 is equal to 3/8x minus 4. Now, we could just, right from the get go, solve this the way we solved everything else, group the x terms, maybe on the left-hand side, group the constant terms on the right-hand side.
Deflection increases!
Welcome to the presentation on age word problems. Let's get started. Well, I already have one written down here.
We have this one, we have 4x plus 1 is greater than 25.
Use the commutative law of addition-- let me underline that-- the commutative law of addition to write the expression 5 plus 8 plus 5 in a different way and then find the sum. Now, this commutative law of addition sounds like a very fancy thing, but all it means is if you're just adding a bunch of numbers, it doesn't matter what order you add the numbers in.
We call that the radius of the circle. It's just the distance from the center out to the edge. If that radius is 3 centimeters, then this radius is going to be 3 centimeters.
So we can subtract 8 from both sides.
Seven times eight you could say has the six in it.
-2,-2 is definitely less than 4 if you take this value right here, this 2.
9/7 is not, it's between, it's between actual integers and we'll plot it here on the number line.
If you were dividing by 1000, you'd move to the left once more.
10 minus 4 is 6 Now this one is lower, so it has to borrow as well Make this into a 16.
If you took this without the absolute value signs, it is also true that -9 is less than -7. Notice the smaller side is on the smaller number. And so that is the interesting thing:
250 miles per hour in that direction, 400 miles per hour in that direction.
Well, she's going to be 2 plus 6, which is, 2 plus 6 which is 8 years old
All of these solutions derive their origins from the text of the book, but once the book designer has read the text, then he has to be an interpreter and a translator. This story was a real puzzle. This is what it's about.
As recently as 1960, 110 million children were born, and 20 million of those died before the age of five. Five years ago, 135 million children were born -- so, more -- and less than 10 million of them died before the age of five. So that's a factor of two reduction of the childhood death rate.
Negative 3 times 4 is negative 12, which is less than 18. So it meets this constraint but won't meet this constraint. Because you do 5 times 4 plus 7 is 27 which is not LESS than 27, it's equal to 27.
1, 2, 3, 4 units, so my change in y, in this example, is negative 4. I went from 1 to negative 3, that's negative 4. That's my change in y.
Now, if we do 5, prime factorization of 5, well, 5 is just 1 and 5, so 5 is a prime number. It is the prime factorization of 5. There's just a 5 there.
6 times 6 is 36, plus 4 is 40.
Two times three plus one is equal to seven. So this seven hundred twenty we just solved, that's literally-- let me write that down.
Solve p=2l+2w for l So this right here, this is just a formula for the perimeter of a rectangle. Perimeter is equal to 2 times the length plus 2 times the width.
How did I know that 15.25 was a mistake? Well, I did a reality check. I said, well, I know in my head that fifteen percent of one hundred is fifteen, so if fifteen percent of one hundred is fifteen, how can fifteen percent of ninety-five be more than fifteen?
So seven out of nine or seven nines are shaded red.
10x4 is 40 Then you have 40 divided by 2 - let me copy and paste all of that again -
What's the largest power of 10 that fits into 6?
Such insanity is happening in the world: people are loving each other who know nothing of love.
I'm making these up on the fly, so I apologize.
And it's going in the other direction.
0.75 goes into 50-- let's add some 0's in the back. If I take this decimal two to the right. Take this decimal, move it two to the right, goes right there.
And we end up with how much of Drink C? 2 plus 1.2 is 3.2 liters of Drink C, which has 25% sugar content. So this is 25% sugar, which also says we know the amount of sugar in it.
We're asked to find the square root of 100. Let me write this down bigger. So the square root is this big check-looking thing.
I'm picking numbers randomly.
(Laughter) Because, not only could people broadcast their stories throughout the world, but they could do so using what seemed to be an infinite amount of devices. For example, one company would tell a story of love through its very own search engine.
Now, a good place to start is to just get rid of these parentheses. And the best way to get rid of these parentheses is to kind of multiply them out. This has a negative 1-- you just see a minus here, but it's just really the same thing as having a negative 1-- times this quantity.
One times one forty-three is one forty-three When you subtract--let's see, this can become an eleven This is a four
We could say 422 decigrams, we could convert that to grams.
And we have already seen that 8 * 1/3 is literally 8 thirds. So we could also write it like this.
Let's write 113.9% (percent) as a decimal. So percent - this symbol right over here - literally means 'per hundred.'
So if you subtract 2 from both sides of this equation, the
So 1 to any power is just going to be equal to 1. And you might say, hey, what about 1 to the 0 power? Well, we've already said anything to 0 power, except for 0-- that's where we're going to-- it's actually up for debate.
This has positive 9 times negative 4x plus 9 plus 4, so this is very close, but this says positive 9, this says negative 9, so I'll cross out one out.
Well, 1 session is gonna cost me $12. This is $15 so $12 is right around there. I'll put it there.
If we have 16 ounces per pound, and we have 6 pounds, we just have to multiply 6 times 16. That'll be the total number of ounces we have. So this is going to be equal to-- what's 6 times 16?
And remember 2x - you can view this as two X's or two times X. And to that I were to add 3 X's How many X's do I have?
Let me this triangle in question. That's the triangle, that's its height, that's its base.
Let's have some practice adding and subtracting negative numbers. So the first example that I want to look at is 2 minus 3. So right now I am just subtracting a positive number from another positive number, but you might already see that I am subtracting a larger number from a smaller number, so I probably or definitely will end up with a negative number.
(Laughter) I was like, "What does that mean?" And they're like, "I'm just saying, you know.
So now that I pointed out to you that I always got confused between those two, it's your job not to be confused by those two.
And this is the ratio of boys to girls.
Should we do the exercise?
Let me get a good problem here. Let's say that we have negative 12. I'm going to change the problem a little bit from the one that I've found here.
8 minus 5 is equal to 3 and just like that using this extra information we're able to figure out that the mass of X is equal to 3.
This right here is a picture of René Descartes Once again one of the great minds, in both math and philosophy. And i think you'll be seeing bit of a little trend here that the great philosphers were also great mathematicians and vice versa and he was somewhat of a contemporary of Galileo he was 32 years younger. although he died shortly after Galileo died.
So 32 times 7. 2 times 7 is 14. 3, which is really a 30 here.
So you would say, well, 77 plus 2, that's 79, so everything in the parentheses just evaluates to 79. And then you still have that plus 3.
Three plus nine is twelve.
And the left side, we get 10x plus 3 equals, and on the right side, all we have left is the negative 5. Almost there, now we're at a level, what is this, a level two problem. And now we just have to take this 3 and move it to the other side.
Fill in the blanks to complete the equation.
Sometimes, they found unoccupied lands, and sometimes they found lands occupied, and wished they weren't.
So let's say I had the fraction 3/5. Well, by the same principle, as long as we multiply the numerator and the denominator by the same numbers, we'll get an equivalent fraction. So if we multiply the numerator times 7 and the denominator times 7, we'll get 21-- because 3 times 7 is 21-- over 35.
I have these 3 star patches - I guess you could call them - right over here. And so I could say,
So our answer to the question "How old is Imran right now?" He is 4 years old. And let's verify this. If he's four years old right now, if 40 years, he's going to be 44.
the two triangles shown below are similar. Identify their corresponding sides and angles. so we see here based on how it's marked this angle is equal to that angle.
So if I go over one in the positive direction, I have to go down 2, that's what a negative slope's going to do, negative 2 slope. If I go over 2, I'm going to have to go down 4.
Here come all the countries: Europe brown, Asia red, Middle East green, Africa South of the Sahara blue, and the Americas yellow. And the size of the country bubble shows the size of the population.
0.3 times 1,000 is 300.
And then 1 plus 4 is 5 and then we bring down the 4. And we have 1, 2, 3, 4 numbers behind the decimal point.
(Laughter) Allow me to tell you about my four minutes of fame. One of the organizers of the Olympic ceremony, of the opening ceremony, called me and said that I had been selected to be one of the flag-bearers.
80 00:04:28,18 --&gt; 00:04:31,99 So now what we can say is, is that the first four exams, I
I have this 3x squared right over there. So plus 3x squared. And then let's see, I have an x term right over here, and that actually looks like the only x term.
Do it because you like to do it. Just 10 years ago, if you had gone to an economist, anywhere,
Let me draw it like this.
So if I have 1 times 10 is clearly just equal to 10 1 times 10 to the negative 1
So you, as the ancient philosopher in mathematics have concluded in order for the multiplication of positive and negative numbers to be consistent with everything you've been constructing so far with all the other properties of multiplication that you know so far that you need a negative number times a positive number or a positive times a negative to give you a negative number and a negative times a negative to give you a positive number and so you accept it's all consistent so far.. this deal does not make complete concrete sense to you, you want to have a slightly deeper institution than just having to accept its consistent with the distributive property and whatever else and so you try another thought experiment, you say "well what is just a basic multiplication way of doing it?"
3 times 5 is 15. So, it is -10 - 15, which is equal to -25. And now, you have the next exercise to practice some of these a little bit more.
But the convention, the tradition that most people use, is that they consider the exponent with x as a base as just one factor, this as just one factor. So traditionally, people will say this has three factors. It has a 5x squared and a y. x squared is just considered a factor.
The multiple of 100 below 152 is 100. So which direction do we go in?
Well, 10 to the fifth power is the same thing as taking a 1 and multiplying it by 10 five times. So let's do that. So that's three, four, and five.
Now, this thing we wanna do multiplication. You could say, "hey, we have the parentheses, why don't we do them first" but when we just evaluate what's inside these parentheses you just get a negative 7, it doesn't really change anything.
So now we have our answer as an improper fraction, but they want it as a mixed number or as a mixed fraction. So what are 63/5? So to figure that out-- let me pick a nice color here-- we take 5 into 63.
"I'm just an innocent schoolteacher." Of course, the terrorists knew that no Indian schoolteacher stays at a suite in the Taj. They picked up his identification, and they phoned his name in to the terrorist war room, where the terrorist war room Googled him, and found a picture and called their operatives on the ground and said,
&gt;&gt; One word to describe cultural humility for me is love actually. &gt;&gt; If I had to encapsulate cultural humility, the whole concepts of cultural humility, it doesn't do it justice, but the word that I think of is essence.
What's the perimeter?
I'll write the 201 and then I'll write the 4 right below it, right below the ones place.
Use the associative law of addition to write the expression. We have a 77 plus 2 in parentheses, plus 3, in a different way.
This is the same thing as 95 plus-- what's 0.15 times 95? Let's see. So let me do this, hopefully I'll have enough space here.
Multiply -9 times (a + b + c), (distribute it) you'll get this right over here. And so this makes it a little bit clearer. What is (a + b + c) equal to?
Let's say that y is equal to number of texts by his younger sister.
So let's rewrite 9 like that. That's equivalent to 3 squared times-- 9 is the same thing as 3 squared to the eighth power, and then all of that to the negative 2 power, right? All I did is I replaced 9 with 3 squared, because we know 3 times 3 is 9.
If you take the absolute value of negative 3 and 1/4, you'll get positive 3 and 1/4, which won't work. 3 and 1/4 is greater than 2 and 1/2, so that's true, that works out. And same thing for 3.
Just complete his question. And this "tiger" about whom you were speaking to me comes closer and closer. That's true.
So you have one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight 1's, and then you're going to multiply them together. And if you were to do that, you would get well, 1 times 1 is 1, times 1-- it doesn't matter how many times you multiply 1 by 1. You are going to just get 1.
But anyway, how can we use this in I guess our basic mathematics?
And another way of saying 25/100 is this is 25 per 100, or 25%. So this is equal to 25%. Now, there's a couple of other ways you could have thought about it.
And we're multiplying that times two to the fifth. And that's two times two times two times two times two. So what do we have here?
3 times negative 2/3, that's negative 2. The 3's cancel out. Plus 4 times 2 is 8.
Well, 8/8 is a whole, and I'll do that over here. I still haven't filled this one in yet, but I'll fill in this one right over here. So let's do that.
(Laughter) And the reporters came too, which lead to bloggers and which lead to a call from something called TED. I had never seen an airplane before.
because the whole thing was upside down. You are told to love your neighbor -- but you have never loved yourself.
So we can rewrite the 92 cans of soda as 2 times 2 times 23 cans of soda for every 2 times 2 times 7 people. Now, both of these numbers have a 2 times 2 in it, or they're both divisible by 4. That is their greatest common factor.
Well that's 2 times 1,200 is 2,400 minutes. Now that's if she was just working on it by herself, but she's got seven friends. And we can assume that they would all take about two minutes to prepare each bag.
It involved plotting 120,000 numbers. Pretty neat, eh?
And let's say that this angle right here is 50 degrees.
So what's 2 plus 2? Well, you know that. That's going to be 4.
We know that if we were to multiply two times three, that would give us positive six. And so we are going to think about negative numbers in this video. One way to think about it, is that I have a positive number times another positive number, and that gives me a positive number.
5 times 1 is 5, plus 2 is 70.
And 18 times 10 is just going to be 180, it's going to be 18 with another 0. So this is going to be 180. Now, the more practice you get, you'll realize that I could say:
Welcome to the presentation on multiplying and dividing negative numbers. Let's get started. I think you're going to find that multiplying and dividing negative numbers are a lot easier than it might
So you get x is equal to 4 divided by 0.2. So let's figure out what 4 divided by 0.2 is. I hope I have enough space.
And literally when we say 1200 square meters, that means if you would have put a 1 meter by 1 meter square here, so really small like that, that you could fit 1200 of these on this plot of land while you could only fit a 1000 of them on this plot of land, these 1 meter by 1 meter squares. So we have a larger area, same neighborhood or comparable neighborhood for the same price. I would go with Apple Lane being the better deal.
Is 19 equal to 2 times 13 minus 7?
"I Can" bug. So, the question is, why only them? In a country of a billion people and some, why so few?
In just a short time, humans from a small corner of Africa had populated all continents except Antarctica, and in there new homes, their languages began to differentiate to form the precursors of today's languages.
We're asked to simplify 5x squared plus 8x minus 3 plus 2x squared minus 7x plus 13x.
Instead of dividing into three groups, what I want to do is say well, if I'm dividing six divided by three, I want to divide it into groups of three. Not into three groups. I want to divide it into groups of three.
So if I were to distribute the 3, 6l minus 3n plus 5m-- and this expression and this expression are going to be equivalent if you just swap the negative 3m and the 5m, which you could completely do. Addition is commutative. It doesn't matter which order you actually add in.
"What is this? The whole world is laid out for you, the best jobs are laid out for you, and you want to go and work in a village? I mean, is there something wrong with you?"
So the inverse of 2/8 is 8/2. You just swap the numerator and the denominator. So let's apply that to part C.
When you get something crazy like 0 equals 1, that's an inconsistent system. That means the lines are parallel.
And so on and so forth. I could keep plotting things. Now, x has to be greater than or equal to negative 75.
We've written seven over eight are shaded red and... actually wait lemme do that in colour, I'll let them have it in exact. We'll get closer to an actual red colour So we like really say seven out of...out of ...like a really grey colour was non-shaded.
1/3 of 48 is equal to 1/3 times 48. And when you multiply-- let me write it like this-- 1/3 times 48, and you could rewrite 48 as a fraction 48/1. It literally represents 48 wholes.
Let's see, 15 times 2 is 30. Nope, not divisible by 9. 15 times 3 is 45, that works.
Thats the same as JL over ZX So two ways to think about it, you can say hey look all of the corresponding angles are the same, And you actually have to look at only two of the angles, because if two of them are the same, the third one is going to be the same.
You're multiplying 2 not just times the a.
200 + 200 is 400, + 320 is 720. So the total perimeter is 720 meters, which is the exact same thing as 0.72 kilometers.
9 times 1 is 9.
Hopefully, I think you have a good idea of how to divide by a fraction now, and you can try out the dividing fractions modules. Have fun!
I told you two videos ago that some people view natural numbers as just the positive, but some people include 0 as a natural number. But in this context it's just the positive integers. I shouldn't have said positive numbers, I should have said positive integers.
So this is going to be equal to the square root of 2 times 2-- I'll put it in parentheses-- 2 times 2, times 2 times 2, times 2 times 2, times 5 times 5, times 5 times 5, right? We have 1, 2, 3, 4, 2's, and then 3, 5's, times 5. Now what is this going to be equal to?
So 48 plus 8 would be, would be 56. So this is gonna be negative 56, negative 56.
5,804 plus 0. Once again, we're adding nothing to it, so it's just 5,804.
So it's 0.002. This is key.
Well, it's just 1.
And so everything we have simplifies to 7 times 2 plus 16 divided by 4 times 2. Now we don't have any parentheses left, so we don't have to worry about the P in PEMDAS. We have no E, no exponents in this.
You get 2x is equal to 4. x equals 2. So Ali is 2 years old today. Let's do another problem.
south - north
1 over 16. So let's do a few more examples of this, just so that we make sure things are clear to us.
What I want to do in this video is think about the types of questions that we need statistics to address and the types of questions that we don't need statistics to address. We could call the ones where we need statistics as statistical questions. And I'll circle the statistical questions in yellow.
Not years. y years.
So we have 375 plus 972, plus 390, plus 400. And so this gets us to 5-- this is the home stretch. We deserve a drum roll now.
We have to rewrite the following fractions with fraction with least common denominator So LCD of the 2 fractions is going to be the LCM of both of these denominators over here. and if we can make this as common denominators we can add the two fractions First let us find the LCM,
Go back to what we were doing, so seven out of eight are shaded red. Let's check our answer... Let's do two more of these.
That's 10 to the minus 6. Now this number right here is 7 times this number, right?
1, 2. Here we have 4 twos and we're adding them together: 1, 2, 3, 4.
What's not exponential form is if we would actually multiply 9 times 9 times 9 times 9 times 9 times 9, which is going to be a very very large number.
share to all and sundry --
Same thing over here and we can keep trying more and more What's neat about these equations is just this equation encapsulates all of the possible combinations here and just this equation encapsulates all the possible combinations there and so for the next few videos, what I want to do is explore How can we use these equations to come up with more insights as to which plan is better for me
Alright, I should do it like they do on Sesame Street, (singing) "1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10-" Oh actually I think I messed up. It's 11.
The esophagus leads down into a dilated part of this tube that we call the stomach, so this is the stomach.
Now let's bring down, now lets bring down another zero 21 goes into 40, well, almost 2 times but not quite, so only 1 time.
Well, I have 21. I have 21 fourths.
Well, the 2 is literally two wholes. You could literally view that if you want. Right here we've drawn each whole.
And well, you'll get a different number but you'll end up with five digits after the eight. But anyway, let me do a couple more computation examples. Let's say we had the numbers -- let me just make something really small -- 0.0000064.
One plus five is six.
Negative two (-2) times negative seven (-7). They are both negatives, and negatives cancel out, so this would give us, this part right over here, will give us positive fourteen (14). And so we're going to multiply positive fourteen (14) times this negative one (-1), times -1.
50 plus 50 is 100, 150, 200, 250, 300, 350. So you could do it that way, but you could imagine that there's an easier way to do it. You just need to realize that 50 is the same thing as 10 times 5.
How much do I have now?
(Laughter) Actually, it's a bit more complex than that, and there are no magic bullets. I don't have all the answers, but I know a few things.
I could just divide 15 into 5 equal groups.
We are asked, what number set does the number 8 belong to? So this is actually a good review of the different sets of numbers that we often talk about.
It's an arbitrary point on the line-- the fact that it's on the line tells us that the slope between a, b and x, y must be equal to m. So let's use that knowledge to actually construct an equation.
20% is equal to-- I'm just writing it out as a word-- 20 percent, which literally means 20 per cent. - Let me break it out - which is the same thing as 20 per cent. And if you're familiar with the word century, you might already know that cent comes from the Latin for the word hundred.
1 liter per 100 centiliters. Here, writing 1 liter per 100 centiliters. We've just flipped it, but they're giving the same information.
We're told to solve for y, and we have this inequality that says that the absolute value of y plus 22 is less than or equal to 13 and 1/2 or 13.5. So a good place to start is maybe to just isolate the absolute value of y on the left-hand side of this inequality.
So 8 plus 20 is 28, so you can view this as 28 minus 11 plus 44.
131.52+15.08 so this going to be 146.60 is right over here. the final answer is 146.6 to the left of 0 the aboslute value is 146.6, and clearly to the left so it is -146.60
And at the store that day they say it is a twenty-five percent off marked price sale. So twenty-five percent off marked price means that if the marked price is one hundred dollars the price I'm going to pay is going to be twenty-five percent less than $one hundred. So my question to you is if I have $fifty, what is the highest marked price I can afford?
Five times three is equal to fifteen.
In the last 20 years I have published a few books, but I have lived in anonymity until February of 2006, when I carried the Olympic flag in the Winter Olympics in Italy. That made me a celebrity. Now people recognize me in Macy's, and my grandchildren think that I'm cool.
Well you know what 1+9 is. 1+ 9=10. And so there's nowhere to carry this 1, so you write the whole thing down here.
We see I'm only using the 6 and 3 because I figured those out ahead of time so I didn't have to do any extra math 2 minus 0 is 2. 5 minus 0 is 5. 9 minus 6 is 3.
"You and your child will die poor." After two weeks of working in that village, it was time to go back.
And so I have two times nine hundred and ninety-nine plus that nine times ninety-nine plus four times nine.
And we don't want to go to just 540. We have another 9 left.
And you could imagine just counting the square meters. In each row we're going to have 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 square meters. And then we have 8 rows.
So this, right here, is-- this value right here is 2/3R plus a. That's what River Orchards has.
Let's say we had to figure out how many times 16 goes into 1,388. And what I want to do is first think about how we traditionally solve a problem like this, and then introduce another method that allows for a little bit more approximation. So traditionally you would say, well sixteen does not go into one any times, so then you move over one spot, and then how many times does it go into 13?
If you want to get rid of a task that you accidentally assigned to yourself, first, click on My tasks, to see your own tasks.
And I'm going to use them to tell you a little bit about my favorite subject: deception.
Many families relocated Willingly, or unwillingly to very distant lands.
From two to four we're going plus two.
So 9 is the same thing as 9000/1000. 9/10-- well, let's see. If you multiplied it by 10, you would get 90 over 100.
It's 2 times 9! and 9 is odd, but not prime.2 doesnt go into it, 3 does. so we have 3 times 3, leaving us with 3.. 3 is prime so were done factoring.
The deepest part of the Bering Strait is at negative 5 and 4/9 kilometers. Write an inequality to show the relationship between these two points, and determine which point is deeper. Let's see.
And then finally, we have-- I don't want to run out of colors here. Finally we have 150%.
I have some footage here. Of one of the most exciting moments in sports history. And to make it even more exciting, the commentator is speaking in German.
And tears will also come to your eyes they are already coming!... Complete the question.
To make it clear 0 times anything is 0 (0x=0) Just for good measure we kind or already went through the answers. But let's try x is equal to 1
P for the pony plus 0.25P for the taxes. So that's that one over there. But if we look at this, you could view this literally as 1P plus 0.25P's.
That is 4 times 8. So this is 4 times 8, and what is this over here in the orange? We have one, two, three, four times.
And you will be surprised that if you are selfish you discover so many treasures within yourself that soon you start sharing them -- because finding a treasure is a lesser joy than sharing it.
So by convention, they created a rule in which they borrowed the CK sound, "ck" sound, from the classical Greek in the form of the letter Kai.
If they didn't divide it into 4 equal sections for us, then it wouldn't have been so easy to just count 2. The number of sections has to be the number in the denominator. And then the number in the numerator's how many of those we move the dot to.
Let me write that down. So, side BE corresponds to side TA. Now we know because this angle corresponds to this angle.
So, this is really the tail end of this 3000-year-long language.
We can also view this triangle from the other way maybe sides BC &amp; side BA have the same length that means angle CAB&amp; angle ABC are the same
If you multiply 0.25 times 100, you're shifting the decimal two to the right.
All right, 2b. Evaluate the following expressions involving variables.
Well, 4 times 4, times 4 is equal to 64, or 4 to the third is equal to 64, which means that 4 is equal to 64 to the 1/3. So this is equal to 4. And, lucky for us, 2 squared is also equal to 4.
And after y years, he's going to be four times as old as Jonathan. Exactly four times.
So I've gone 1, 2, 3. So this point right over here on the number line, this is 3/4. This point right over here, what do you think this is going to be?
An analogy would be if you had an 8 meter by 8 meter room, how much carpeting would you need is kind of the size of the space you need to fill out in two dimensions on some type of surface.
This 30 plus the 40 gets us to a 70. In other words, a 3 plus a 4 in the tens place.
Now, our whole goal, just to remember, is to isolate the x. We have a negative 13 times the x here. So the best way to isolate it is if we have something times x, if we divide by that something, we'll isolate the x.
They ask us 150 is 25% of what number? So another way to think about it is 25% times some number, so I will do 25% in yellow.
So let's work that out here. $125 times 0.75. And just in case you're confused, I don't want to repeat it too much, but if something shrinks by twenty-five percent it is now seventy-five percent of its original value. So if $125 shrinks by 25% it's now 75% of $125 or 0.75.
(Applause) We consistently underestimate what criminals and terrorists can do. Technology has made our world increasingly open, and for the most part, that's great, but all of this openness may have unintended consequences.
Some populations probably didn't survived the ice age and those that did often became more isolated from other groups, scattered around the world, these small populations became more being culturally, and genetically distinct from one another.
So think of it this way- I'm picking 873 because its leading digit is as closer than 9 as possible But it's definitely lower than the 9
Then we know that the height right here is 8 meters. It's a square. This distance up here is going to be the same as this distance down here -- it's going to be another 8 meters.
If we just want an x over here, we can just divide both sides by 2.
So we get 4 (-18) = (X/4) 4, the (X/4) * 4 ... that cancels out ... you divide something by 4 and multiply by 4, you're just going to be left with an "X". And on the other side... 4 X (-18) ... well let's see that's 40... well, let's just write it out. ... so 18 X 4 ... if we were to multiply 18 X 4 ... 4 X 8 = 32, 4 X 1 = 4, plus 1 is 72 -- but this is (-18) X 4, so it's (-72). So X = -72.
13 plus 5 is 18. This is 18.
1 and 17 will definitely go into 17, 2 doesn't go into 17, 3 doesn't go, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, ... none of those numbers, nothing between 1 and 17 goes into 17, so 17 is prime. And now I'll give you a hard one. This one can trick a lot of people.
We have 100. So the multiplicative inverse of that is just going to be 1/100. And if you multiplied that times that, you'd get 1.
Yeah, because even if we did the 2 and the 4 here, we would have to get to-- let's see, 8 would get us to-- this is 2/22 plus 4/22 is 6/22, plus 8/22 is going to be 14/22, yeah. And then if you put 16/22, there's going to be too many. So actually, the way we did it was the way that you've got to do it.
Translate your YouTube videos and grow your audience globally with the help of your friends by using YouTube's "Request Translation" feature.
So I really just have to think about what 141 - 9 is.
Solve for x. And we have 5x plus 7 is greater than 3 times x plus 1. So let's just try to isolate "x" on one side of this inequality.
Negative 6 minus 4 is negative 10. So when x is equal to negative 16, it does satisfy the original equation. Both sides of the equation become negative 10.
Carry the 1, or regroup the 1. We can ignore these guys right now.
Or another way to think about it is that 4 is 2/3 of 6.
So we want to focus on the tens place.
Well, 1 times 5 is 5.
So we could say that p is equal to 15 divided into 5 equal groups.
(Laughter) I'm used to a stationary mic. It's the sensible shoe of public address.
1, bring down the 0.
So let's see, they say find the prime factorization of 42. So when their saying prime factorization, you know when your saying, since you wrote this, your saying factor this and all the numbers that when I multiply them together I get to 42.
1.3, let's substitute it back.
The mid-1990s, Microsoft started an encyclopedia called Encarta. They had deployed all the right incentives, They paid professionals to write and edit thousands of articles.
So if I take 7/8 times 8-- well, that's going to be 7. Let me write this down. 7 over 8 times 8 is equal to 7.
Just step out of your house, raise your voice and say, "We would like to see the end of the regime." This is what happened in Tunisia. Over a few days, the Tunisian regime that invested billions of dollars in the security agencies, billions of dollars in maintaining, trying to maintain, its prisons, collapsed, disappeared, because of the voices of the public.
Let me think about that. 12 goes into 54.
And I'm very honored by the fact that Michel invited me, only a few months ago, to become a UNAlDS ambassador. And in this way, I've been strengthening my platform and broadening my outreach.
I've already gotten 8 and 2 Now I've got 8 groups of 2 instead of two groups of 8 but they're still both factors and you go back to 16 and 1 So, I think we're done.
And for not going into decimals, you're kind of done, because 16 does not go into 12, so 16 goes into 1388 eighty-six times with a remainder of 12. And that's all a decent way of doing it. And that's the way you traditionally know how to do it, but what I wanna do is to introduce another, maybe a little more interesting way to solve a long division problem.
4 times 5 is 20, and then you subtract, and you have no left over, as we expect, because it should go in evenly. This number ends with a 0 or a 5. Let me delete all of this so we can have our scratch space to work with later on.
520, or what number before we figured out it was 520, that's what we're taking the percentage of. This is sometimes referred to as the base. That is the base.
If we try to factor out a 5...we'd get 5 times ...times...3/5a plus b is equal to 2. But neither of these gets us in a form where we can then solve for a plus b. So in this situation, we actually do not have enough information to solve this problem.
On your math quiz, you earn five points for each question that you answer correctly in the table below, x represents the number of questions you answer correctly and y represents the total number of points that you score on your quiz fair enough? The relationship between these two variables can be expressed by the following equation y = 5x Graph the equation below
Determine whether 30/45 and 54/81 are equivalent fractions. Well, the easiest way I can think of doing this is to put both of these fractions into lowest possible terms, and then if they're the same fraction, then they're equivalent.
Let me put that 1 on a stack right above that 1. I have a 0-- let me put the 0 to the left of the 1. I want to put them in order.
So this is going to be equal to the -( abs(-15)+abs(-46)+abs(-29)) and the reason why we are writing this. this might look fancy but this is really just the length of this purple arrow. This absolute value of 46, that's really just the length of the green arrow, 46. This is just the length of the orange arrow.
Let's have -- let me say, x plus two over x plus one is equal to, let's say, seven. So, here, instead of having just an x in the denominator, we have a whole x plus one in the denominator. But we're going to do it the same way.
Minus eightx. Well, on the right-hand side the eightx's cancel out. On the left-hand side we have minus fivex plus six is equal to, on the right-hand side all we have left is forty.
We're asked to subtract and simplify the answer, and we have 8/18 minus 5/18. So subtracting fractions is very similar to adding fractions. If we have the same denominator, the denominator in the difference is going to be the same as the denominators in the two numbers that we're subtracting, so it's going to be 18.
(Laughter) Hello!
Well, we apply the same formula.
It needs to run 9 feet to get across the road.
0.2-- let me write it over here --is equal to 20/100, which is equal to 1/5. So we can rewrite this right here as 1/5. So 2/5 m plus 500 minus 1/5 times 2/5 plus 5 2/5 m plus 500.
Hey, I took away some number from 5, and I got 3.
1 and 7/68 is the same thing as 1 plus 7/68. And that's the same thing as you know from the fractions module, as 68/68 plus 7/68. And that's the same thing as 68 plus 7--75/68.
So let's see, 6 goes into 54 9 times.
0.889. Hopefully the doctor won't mind. So that is equal to-- I'll write it in a nice, vibrant color-- 0.889 milliliters of solution per dose.
When you divided 12 into groups of three, each of the groups have a 4 in it, so x must be equal to 4. x is equal to 4. Let's do another one, and this time I won't draw it all out like this, but hopefully, you'll see that the same type of processes are involved.
So, lets identify all the rays shown in the image below, we can start anywhere, we will start at point J, the only line segment we have starting from J is JH going up, goes upto H and keeps on going in that direction beyond H, ray JH, starting from J going through H and going beyond it forever now if we go to H, there is no ray HJ as the line ends in J and does not keep going beyond J, there is no ray H as it is just one point, just usiing one point, we cannot say it as a ray. now looking at our diagram the only ray is JH.
There is no hope once you are in it, you are in it.
And just to be clear sometimes cyanobacteria, which we talked about as the first photosynthetic organism Sometimes that's called blue-green algae but that's really bacteria. Algae is considered eukaryotic it just doesn't have the structures of modern plants.
36, well, that is divisible by 12. That is 12 times 3. So 9 goes into 36 and 12 goes into 36.
Literally multiply 8.23 times 10 to the 10 and you will get this number. Maybe you could try it with something smaller than ten to the ten.
They're usually saying, well, what is the y-coordinate when x equals 0.
To 80 just to make sure we got the right answer. Let's do a couple more of these. The following table shows equivalent fractions to 27 75ths, so then they wrote all of the different equivalent fractions.
9 you might be tempted to say is prime, but remember, it's also divisible by 3, so 9 is not prime. Prime is not the same thing as odd numbers. Then if you move to 10, 10 is also not prime, divisible by 2 and 5.
So we get 15/36 is the same thing as 5/12. And just going to our original example, all that's saying is, if I had a pie with 12 pieces and I ate 5 of them. Let's say I did that.
CAF and FAB together definitely add up to 180 degrees so they're supplementary.
So if I took 7.345 times 1,000. The way I do it is, I ignore the 0's. I essentially multiply 1 times that guy up there.
Well, 1/2 is literally halfway between 0 and 1.
You can ride your bike 1/5 of a mile per minute. If it takes you 3 and 1/3 minutes to get to your friend's house, how many miles away does your friend live?
8 goes into 40 five times.
(let me do that in a white coulour, I do not like that brown) Now, what I want you to think about, and you can think about it either through the symbols or through the scales, is: how would you go about -- let us think about a few things: how would you first go about at least getting rid of these little 1kg blocks? I will give you a second to think about that...
So the 0.7 becomes a 7. Ignore that right there.
So if it's a four-digit number-- so it's one, two, three, four-digit number-- whatever I put here, this is going to represent thousands. Whatever I put here is going to represent hundreds. Whatever I put here represents tens.
There's also the six emotions and that elusive x-factor. Maybe that could be the topic of my next talk. Until then, please have fun using the five senses in your own lives and your own designs.
Ten years of sannyas have finally brought me to a total chaos.
I want it to be a stand alone virtual school where anyone in the world who wants to learn anything can go there, start from the basics progress as far as they need to go, get feedback, get assessment, get practice and eventually I want it to actually become the operating system for what goes on in the classroom where every student is allowed to work at their own pace and the teacher actually becomes more of a mentor or more of a coach. So I see Sal Khan as a pioneer and an overall movement to use technology to let more and more people learn things, know where they stand. the start of a revolution!
Well, that's... once again, we have the same scale it's important to always check the scale
4 times 2r is 8r, 4 times negative 13 over 4 is negative 13, is less than-- and I multiplied by a positive number so I didn't have to worry about swapping the inequality-- is less than 5/2 times 4 is 10, right? You get a 2 and a 1, it's 10. So you get 8r minus 13 is less than 10.
If t, m, and s represent the ages in years of Todd, Marta, and Susan respectively, which of the following is true?
It was 9.58, 9.58 seconds, and I'll just write s for seconds. So given this information here what you need to attempt to do is now give us our rate in terms of meters per second. I want you to think if you can figure out the rate in terms of meters per second.
3 is equal to 3x. And then you have your minus 2 there. You have your minus 2.
So let's just think about some potential x and y values here. So let's think about some potential x and y values.
You go for a job interview. And the first thing your interviewer says is, "Look you have great work experience, you seem like a nice young person, but what I really care about is your logical reasoning capabilities."
So with that said, 1 to the zeroth power is just going to be 1. Anything other than zero to the zeroth power is 1. So we have 4 times 1 which is 4, minus 2 times 1 which is 2.
15 times 5 is 75. That looks about right, so we say five times.
So what's remaining is 3 out of the original 8 equal parts or 3/8 of the pizza is remaining. So let's input that. So we could go right here.
And you could try out any value less than 1/10 and verify that it will satisfy this inequality.
Millimeter, milli means 1/1,000 of a meter. Foot, that is also a unit of length.
the more goes on entering you from unknown sources.
And then 100 divided by 4 is 25.
So 4 times 5, that's our c, plus d. d is minus or negative 4. So we have 4 times 5 is 20, plus negative 4-- that's the same thing as minus 4, so that is equal to 16. Problem 6.
Kids sitting in front of unimpressed panels, you know, with their resumes -- (Laughter)
So 4 is 12/3, minus 14/3... ...so I just want to be clear: I just re-wrote the 4 as 12/3. So 12/3 minus 14/3, or negative 14/3 plus 12/3, is going to give us... ...we have the same denominator of 3, so we are going to have 12 minus 14 is negative 2.
And since we divided by a negative number, we swap the inequality. It goes from less than or equal to, to greater than or equal to. So we have our two constraints. x has to be less than 2 and 4/5, and it has to be greater than or equal to negative 1.
So if we were to multiply three times negative two, it shouldn't matter. The order which we multiply things don't change, or shouldn't change the product.
Well, you could start with a 1 and then multiply it by negative 1 four times, so a negative 1 times negative 1, times negative 1, times negative 1, which is just going to be equal to positive 1. So if someone were to ask you-- we already established that if someone were to take 1 to the, I don't know, 1 millionth power, this is just going to be equal to 1. If someone told you let's take negative 1 and raise it to the 1 millionth power, well, 1 million is an even number, so this is still going to be equal to positive 1.
2x minus 9x, If we simplify that, that's negative 7x. You get negative 7x is equal to negative 7x. And you probably see where this is going.
That's 100 out of 100 right there.
3 goes into-- well, 3 doesn't go into 1.
We're asked, "What is the greatest common divisor of 20 and 40?" Another way to say this is, "gcd(20, 40) =?" And "greatest common divisor" sounds like a very fancy term, but it's really just saying:
6 plus 33 would be 39 and then you have another 10, so it's 49. So it's equal to 49/36. Now, can we simplify this?
"Algebra means restoration or completion" restoration... restoration or completion... completion And he associated it in his book with a very specific operation, really taking something from one side of an equation to another side of an equation. But we can actually see it right over here.
So the inverse of negative 3/1 is negative 1/3, and this equals negative 1/6. Let's do it the other way.
And, and the equation is saying that should equal minus 11 over 3, that's what x is, plus an 8 is nothing more than 24 over 3.
2, 8, 25. 34 00:01:36,91 --&gt; 00:01:40,88 So 4 goes into 29 7.25 times.
So we could say that the total is going to be equal to 63 plus 9 times 2. And we'll talk more about order of operations. Clearly in this situation, we want to multiply 9x2 to figure out the total new number of seats.
It always helps me to see a lot of examples of something so I figured it wouldn't hurt to do more scientific notation examples. So I'm just going to write a bunch of numbers and then write them in scientific notation. And hopefully this'll cover almost every case you'll ever see and then at the end of this video, we'll actually do some computation with them to just make sure that we can do computation with scientific notation.
So let's say that we wanted to compare the absolute value of 2 to the absolute value of 3. Well the absolute value of a positive is just going to be that same value. 2 is 2 to the right of 0.
So 92 is 2 times 46, which is 2 times 23.
"Hey, I've got these two different models for creating an encyclopedia.
So 67 times 1 times 10 times 10 times 10 times 10 times 10. And we already figured out exactly what this is.
This is the largest So I will write it, I will order this way
And what we're thinking about is this. What should we call this number here? This number is clearly between 0 and 1.
So one way we can view this, this is the same thing, this is equal to, negative 1/3 times 6z minus 2. These two things are equivalent. Right?
So halfway in between is 150.
You could try to turn 1/10 into hundredths. And the best way to do that, if you want the denominator to be increased by a factor of 10, you need to do the same thing to the numerator. So all I did is I multiplied the numerator and denominator by 10.
When you look at what the leading candidates in your own party are doing now -- I mean, there's -- are you excited by their plans on global warming?
So 3 times 10 to the ninth, I'm just going to rewrite that as 3 times 10 to the ninth. And we're dividing that by 30,000, which is the exact same thing as 3 times 10 to the-- we have one, two, three, four zeros here. 3 times 10 to the fourth.
So any point on this line, or any x, y on this line, would have to satisfy the condition that the slope between that point-- so let's say that this is some point x, y.
So it's going to go 6 times - 6 × 20 = 120. You subtract.
39 divided by 3 is 13. So, let me subtract 26/3 from both sides.
And I could draw it. And I'm going to do it on the tool in a second as well. So it'll look something like this.
These numbers are big. And then one hundred and fifty-three minus eighty-five.
And twenty-eight over five -- let's see, five goes into twenty-eight five times, twenty-five.
If I had said 5 times 3 plus 7, now, if you were to work this out using order of operations, you'd say, this is 5 times 10.
It doesn't go into 19. It does go into 190.
The square root of 2000. I'll do it down here.
55 over 1. 55 miles per hour. Now this guy went 82-1/2 miles in 1-1/2 hours.
now we're going to stop this rotation but i can talk to you about what is happening here i don't know about you but i'm busy in d fixed fame of reference there was no one balanced force within the frame of reference for taking in this turntable there was and unbalanced because the velocity kept changing was with the fictitious part rotating plane is unknown inertial or accelerated fame just as the accelerated frame of the karte the doctor humes showed you you know that every object which is moving in a circle has an acceleration toward the center of the circle this is the exploration of has a special namely and capital acceleration now you will this puck for a while workstudy while the turntable is rotating i'll get off theoretic i'm ready but the rotation
starts at A or has a vertex at A and lets say that there is also a ray AC. So lets say that C is sitting right over there and then i can draw another ray that goes through C, so this is ray AC. and what's interesting
And on the right hand side, I can just distribute this 3, so 3 times 2 is 6 3 times y is 3y 6 plus 3y And then it's always nice to get all of our constants on one side of the equation All of our variables on the other side of the equation
Show 109% by shading. So just as a bit of review, 109% if we were to write it out, would literally be 109 percent, which is the same thing as 109 per-- and I could write cent again, but that's getting old.
(Music) That's them rolling. And in two hours, after their backs were broke, they were changed.
Between six to 14 year-old children participate in a democratic process, and they elect a prime minister. The prime minister is 12 years old. She looks after 20 goats in the morning, but she's prime minister in the evening.
So lets really quickly review, exactly what a proton is referring to so in the most common isotope of hydrogen there's one proton in the nucleus, and there's an electron somewhere outside of our nucleus, so here is a very simple picture of a hydrogen atom. This is a neutral hydrogen atom.
Now I need to subtract 60. And so I can think about the question,"What is 20?"
How many times does five go into fourteen? Well, let's see.
You are loving the neighbor -- you who knows nothing of love because you have never loved yourself. The neighbor is loving you -- he has never loved himself.
So I found a therapist. My first meeting with her, Diana -- I brought in my list of the way the whole-hearted live, and I sat down.
Nine half yards times thirty six inches per yard. Yard in the numerator, yard in the denominator. We are left with nine over two times thirty six over one inches.
So plus 8/1000. So let's put everything in terms of thousandths so that we can add these all up and have two fractions over thousandths, or things in terms of thousandths.
So 13 ÷ 20 (or 13/20) ... We have the smaller number, in this case, being divided by the larger number. So, we're going to get a value less than 1.
You say forty divided by five is equal to eight groups. Every group has three girls.
Actually this units aren't squared feet, this is in tiles. This is feet divided by feet, and so this is going to be 114, 114 tiles. Obviously it is not going to be exactly 114 tiles, but based on the precision of the measurements we have done, we can say 114 tiles.
Now that have a basic understanding of what a ratio is, let's see if we can tackle some more advanced problems. So, I have a classroom. It's got fifty-five students in it. fifty-five students.
This one and this one are going to be obtuse so very simple idea if one line or if one ray is relative to the other one is straight up and down versus left to the right or is completely upright then we're talking about a right angle if they are closer to each other if you had to rotate them less you're talking about a acute angle if you had to rotate them more you are talking about an obtuse angle and I think if you look at them visually it's pretty easy to pick out
I didn't say these were going to be perfect. So most of you think of Google as something that lets you look up a web page, but it is also a dictionary. Type the word "define" and the word you want to know.
"Akansha" and "Teach for India". And through them I am learning to focus on bridging the inequity gap in education for the underprevileged. I have been struggling for years to be true to myself and not define myself as society wants me to be.
And so you said 20 plus 8x is equal to 12 plus s. Or another way you could say it is the C that 20 plus 8s gets is going to be the same as the C that 12s gets. So we just equate them and then you solved for s.
If L is 6 and S is 5, will this equality hold? We're going to have 5 times 6 tiles plus 2 times 5 small tiles.
In the last couple of videos we saw that we can describe a curves by a position vector-valued function. And in very general terms, it would be the x position as a function of time times the unit vector in the horizontal direction. Plus the y position as a function of time times the unit victor in the vertical direction.
4 times 0.25 is the same thing as 4 times 1/4, which is a whole. And 4 times 150 is 600. So you would have gotten it either way.
The other thing that they had in common was this:
So we could split right over there. And we want to go exactly one of those sections.
The 48 is this purple area right over here. So let me write it over here.
So if this is a magnet, we know that a magnet always has two poles. It has a north pole and a south pole. And these were just labeled by convention.
We are left with how many times does 16 go into 108. And we can go back to..., we know 16 times 5 is 80.
And we had a Y and we've took away one of the Y. So we're left with no Y. We see that visually, we're left with just an X here. And what do we have on the right hand side?
30 times 6 would be 180. So let's go with it going 6 times. Let's see if that works out.
And we're done.
So if I were to actually draw a number line, you would see that.
So 2 is going to be 1-- we're only going to multiply it by the 2. I'll use this for multiplication. I'll use the dot.
"That's an amazing discovery, guys, and I will improve upon your technology," but he didn't. He wasn't first, he didn't get rich, he didn't get famous, so he quit. People don't buy what you do; they buy why you do it.
[Ben] Yes actually. We do mark that wrong.
And I could keep going. I could call this right over here-- I've traveled 5 out of the 5 equal sections towards 5, so I could call this right over here 5.
12 years ago, William, so this is William 12 years ago.
A group of 60 minutes is an hour. So this 549 minutes is 9.15 hours. I want to make sure that we can visualize that properly.
I'm going to have a couple of beers and a banana nut muffin. (Laughter) I don't want to feel these.
So, what percentage of the DNA in your chromosomes do you share with other species?
So went into it almost exactly 7 times, so this value right here, almost 0.7. So if you say how many times 13 goes into 120?
If 78 is a small percentage of some number, that means that number has to be pretty big, and our answer gels with that. This looks about right.
I felt the responsibility to phone our correspondents there and to phone our newsroom and to tell them, "Make your best not to switch off the cameras at night, because the guys there really feel confident when someone is reporting their story -- and they feel protected as well." So we have a chance to create a new future in that part of the world. We have a chance to go and to think of the future as something which is open to the world.
(Laughter) (Applause) And she looks back and does this,
It goes into 150 5 times.
And then this-- 390 times 2 is 78, yeah. And then this is 2 times, what?
Is it true that 1,500 is less than 1,500? No.
That's my triangle. And let's say that this distance right here is 7 centimeters right down there.
--is if this is 120 degrees, this angle right here has to be supplementary to that; it has to add up to 180.
Well, if we did that to the denominator, we also have to do that to the numerator, so 11 times 3 is 33. And just like that, we've now rewritten each of the fractions so that they have the same denominator. Both of their denominators is 36.
This is, right over here, 1/4 of the circumference. So this angle right over here is going to be 1/4 of 360 degrees. 360 degrees divided by 4 is going to be 90 degrees.
10 to the 23rd power. That's equal to what? That equals 1 with twenty-three 0's.
So it's 1 times 10 times 10 times 10 times 10 times 10. Notice one, two, three, four, five. And what's this going to be?
3 times 9 minus 1 is what? This is 3 times 8. This is 24.
We want to keep adding zeroes to get a decimal answer right over here. So let's put a decimal right over here. We're going into the tenths place.
And I must tell you that after 20 years, I have not made one percent of change in the professional practice of this art. That is a great tragedy -- which I'm carrying still with me and I hope that all of you will carry this with you -- that the profession still legitimizes publication of knowledge of people without attributing them by making them anonymous.
So when I said that, they said, "Well show us what is possible. What are you doing? This is all mumbo-jumbo if you can't show it on the ground."
And then when you multiply 0.72 times 1,000, you could just first say, "OK, let's take 72 times 1,000." 72 times 1,000 would be 72 with 3 0s.
Multiplying by 1/3 is the same thing as dividing by 3. So we multiply both sides by one-third. When you multiply by one-third, visually, over here, if you had 3 X's and you multiplied by 1/3, you would have only one X left.
So 12 goes into 95 seven times. You get 7 wholes and you have 11 left over.
If you only multiplied the 5 times the 3, you'd have 15, and then plus the seven, you'd get the wrong answer. You're multiplying 5 times these things, you have to multiply 5 times both of these things. Because you're multiplying the sum of these guys.
We're subtracting 400, and we're subtracting 150. So these two would be the same thing as subtracting 550. And then we have a positive 237, and we're adding it to a positive 450.
Let's multiply 7 times 253 and see what we get. So just like in the last example what I'd like to do is I'd like to rewrite the largest number first (so that's 253) and then write the smaller number below it and align the place value, the 7, it only has an ones place.
And we can divide both sides by 6 - divide both sides by 6 - and we get, we get - this left hand side is 5, 30/6 = 5 - 5 = k or k=5 so the second sentence tells us - this gives us the information that y is not just kx, it tells us that y = 5x. y is 30 when x is 6.
See if we can go from 44.89 to 45, cuz this is really close already. And if this is. Well let's just try it out.
Some of the ice in the icebergs that I photograph is very young -- a couple thousand years old. And some of the ice is over 100,000 years old.
And 25% times some number is equal to 150. So the percent is pretty easy to spot. We have a 25% right over here.
1 kilometer is 1,000 meters. Now, if you multiply these two things, the kilometers cancel out. You're just going to be left with the meters.
What happens if you take away that -3? Well, that should get you back to 0. If you take away anything... if you have something and you take it away, it should go back to 0.
And we're done.
The mother came to me, knelt down, and said, "Leymah, take my daughter. I wish for her to be a nurse." Dirt poor, living in the home with my parents,
Well, we've moved 1, 2 of the spaces towards 4, so this is 2/4. And this space right over here, or this mark right over here on the number line, what is that going to be? Well, we've moved 1 of the 4 spaces towards 1.
11 goes into 120-- now you know, if with you know your multiplication tables through 11, that this won't work, but I'll just show you.
How many of you, if you did something that was hurtful to me, would be willing to say, "I'm sorry. I made a mistake?" How many of you would be willing to say that?
So the left-hand side is just x. x is less than negative 4 divided by 4 is negative 1. x is less than negative 1. Or we could write this in interval notation. All of the x's from negative infinity to negative 1, but not including negative 1, so we put a parenthesis right there.
If we divide both sides by 3, this and ' equivalent to multiply both side of equacao by 1/3 Now let's do one more and I'll make it a little more complicated I'll modify the ftminword_len a little
(Laughter) I miss Michael. And sure enough, somebody from MCA Universal calls our legal department to see if they can maybe look into buying the rights to the image, just in case they might want to use it.
Welcome to the presentation on BASlC ADDlTION. I know what you're thinking: "Sal, addition doesn't seem so basic to me."
(Applause) (Music) Terribly sorry. I forgot the floor.
So one way to think about it, so we start off with-- So when x is equal to 1, let's say that x is equal to the term, we add just this 1 there. Then when x is equal to 2, we added one column of four. So this is when x is equal to 2, we have one column of four.
Each corresponding as t gets larger and larger, we're just going to different-- we're specifying different points on the path. We saw that two videos ago. And in the last video we thought about, well, what does it mean to take the derivative of a vector-valued function?
So they are supplementary, let me write that down, Angle DBA and angle ABC are supplementary, they add up to 180 degrees, but they are also adjacent angles, they are also adjacent, and because they are supplementary and they're adjacent, if you look at the broader angle, the angle formed from the sides they don't have in common, if you look at angle DBC, this is going to be essentially a straight line, which we can call a straight angle.
Let's add four elevenths to nine over thirteen In order to add these two fractions we need to find a common denominator And that common denominator used to be the least common multiple of eleven and thirteen
15/4 is what?
Then we'll have to do the same thing over here. If 36 is 9/2 times 8, let me write this. 8 * 9/2 = 36.
Solve for y? We have 3y plus 7 is less than 2y and 4y plus 8 is greater than negative 48. So we have to find all the y's that meet both of these constraints.
I wrote a letter last week talking about the work of the foundation, sharing some of the problems. And Warren Buffet had recommended I do that -- being honest about what was going well, what wasn't, and making it kind of an annual thing. A goal I had there was to draw more people in to work on those problems, because I think there are some very important problems that don't get worked on naturally.
2 + 3 over 8. Which is going to be equal to 5&amp;#x2F;8 of the eyes.
We have 5z + 7 is less than 27. Let's isolate the z's on the left hand side, so lets subtract 7 from both sides to get rid of this 7 on the left hand side.
(Laughter) (Applause) It's a great cover. If you notice, he's actually needlepointing his own face.
7 is a very bizarre number, and just to test it, you could think of other ways to do it.
So once again, we round it up to 103.6. And to see why that makes sense, let's do a little bit of an example here with actually measuring something. So let's say we have a block here,
I was born with an immune deficiency, with a life expectancy of only one year. I had to undergo a bone marrow transplant at the age of six months.
- if we re-write the four-thirds - this is the same thing as 2 times -- instead of writing this as 4/3 like this I will write it as four thirds. I know it sounds like
(Laughter) He said, "He was in a car wreck, and I pulled him out, gave him CPR, and I saved his wife's life as well." He said, "I think he thinks better of me now."
So we can multiply by 2 to get 6. So this is multiplying by 2. And each of the 2 in green, there now each of those sections have now been divided into 2.
let me just put some letters here to specify, 'X', 'Y' and 'Z'. Let's say that the measure of angle XYZ is equal to 60 degrees, and let's say you have another angle, that looks like this, and I'll call this, maybe 'M', 'N', 'O', and let's say that the measure of angle MNO is 120 degrees.
Inorder to be divisible by 8 we need to have three 2's in the prime factorization.
And then we multiply it out.
Somewhere in here there is actually a series of photographs -- here we go. This is actually a poster of Notre Dame that registered correctly. We can dive in from the poster to a physical view of this environment.
I won't write the unit. This is m/s times s and it'll give us the answer in m
If we divide both sides of this equation by 80, so you divide the left-hand side by 80, the right-hand side by 80, you get x. x is equal to 100/80. They both share a common factor of 20, so 100 divided by 20 is 5, and 80 divided by 20 is 4. So in simplest form, x is equal to 5/4, but I've only expressed it as a fraction.
Now if I were to actually divide this out, we could see -- actually we could just divide the numerator and the denominator by six. six goes into three hundred and thirty-six, what, fifty-six times? fifty-six over ten, and then we can divide that again by two.
Well, once again, S is equal to 6 feet. So the giraffe's height is equal to 3 times Shantanu's height, which we now know to be 6 feet, so 3 times 6 feet. So in feet, the giraffe's height is 3 times 6.
-3 plus -7 Now we could draw a number line here, just to help us visualize it
All numbers divisible by both 12 and 20 are also divisible by and the trick here is to realize that if a number is both divisible by 12 and 20 it has to be divisible by each of these guy's prime factors
5 doesn't go into 1. It goes into 17 three times.
Now, one day, our carpenter in our hourse accidentally spilled some oil on the floor and then he cleaned using some saw dust. When I observed the saw dust carefully, I saw the oil was stuck to its surface.
Well, where does 152 sit?
And he, the positive soul that he is, said, "No, this is just a hiatus, a hiatus during the treatment, and you'll get back to doing what you do best." I realized then that I, who thought I had complete control of my life, had control of only three things: My thought, my mind -- the images that these thoughts created -- and the action that derived from it.
7 times 1 is 7, and you're going to have 2 left over.
And we know what 17 plus 5 is. We've done that before.
1,555 times 1. Well, anything times 1 is going to be that anything, so this is essentially saying one 1,555. So that's just going to be 1,555.
Round 423,275 to the nearest thousand.
Here it's incrementing by one, but the ratios are not the same.
And so we see conceptually that 1/2 times 1/4, it completely makes sense, that 1/2 of 1/4 should be 1/8. And it hopefully makes sense that you get this 8 by multiplying the 2 times the 4. You started with 4 equal sections, but then you divided each of those 4 equal sections into 2 equal sections.
So 1/2 times 3 times 4.
And this is by Side Side Side (SSS) congruency. All three sides, they have three corresponding sides that are congruent to each other.
We get 3x is less than or equal to fifteen. So this statement and this statement are once again the exact same thing. Now going back here if we want to isolate the x, we divide by three.
(Music) Atul Karwal: aProCh is an organization which has been doing things for kids earlier. And we plan to extend this to other parts of the city.
Now, 15 is 1.5 times 10, and then we have to multiply that times, times 10 to the tenth, not X to the 10th, times 10 to the tenth power, this right over here. 10 is really just 10 to the first power, so we can just add the exponent, same base taking the product, so this is equal to 1.5 times 10 to the 1 plus 10 power, or 10 To the eleventh power, and we are done. This is a huge, a huge distance, this just so that you can well, it's actually almost, it's very hard to visualize.
Or I could actually draw a number line, and actually let me do it here just to start off the video to get warmed up.
You started at negtive 2, you started 2 to the left of 0, and then we're going to go 3 to the right, we're adding 3.
"We don't believe you.
And if you start with that number, p-- so this is Paulette's distance from school so, p-- and you multiply it by 5. So that's times 1, times 2, times 3, times 4, times 5. So notice this is p, this distance is p right over here, this is another p right over here, this is another p right over here, that's another p right over there, and another p right over there.
And so 9 10's minus 8 10's is equal to 1 10. And then 10 -1 is 9. So it's equal to 19.
We found some non-toxic refrigerants that worked at very low vapor pressures. Brought in a team from the U.K. -- there's a lot of great refrigeration people, it turned out, in the U.K. -- and built a test rig, and proved that, in fact, we could make a low pressure, non-toxic refrigerator. So, this is the way it works.
And 49 - 25 is equal to 24. And we are done.
Negative one / six. The left-hand side, negative one over six times negative six. Well that just equals one.
Humans usually have 46 chromosomes, two sets of 23, or simply 23 pairs of chromosomes. Chimpanzees have two sets of 24, or 24 pairs of chromosomes. Rhesus monkeys have 21 pairs of chromosomes.
If x represents the distance of an object from the center of the black hole, write an inequality for safe distances from the center of the black hole in terms of x and E.
The square root of 4 is 2, leave the 6 in, and you would have gotten the 2 square roots of 6. Which you will get the hang of it eventually, but I want to do it systematically first. Let's do part C.
And so seven stars would stand for "elu meen," which is the Dravidian word for the Big Dipper star constellation. Similarly, there's another sequence of six stars, and that translates to "aru meen," which is the old Dravidian name for the star constellation Pleiades. And finally, there's other combinations, such as this fish sign with something that looks like a roof on top of it.
Each iceberg has its own individual personality. They have a distinct way of interacting with their environment and their experiences. Some refuse to give up and hold on to the bitter end, while others can't take it anymore and crumble in a fit of dramatic passion.
So 3 times 150 is 450. So now we have the same denominator, and we can now add our numerators. So this is going to be equal to-- actually,
1, 2, 3, 4. So this is equal to positive 4. So we'll plot it right here.
7.23, let's see what it will be. 7.2, let's see, 0.2 times, it's like 1/5, it'll be like 41 something. So this is approximately, approximately, 41 times 10 to the 1.
150 000 hours, at the speed of a bullet, or the speed of a jet plane to get to the Sun, and just to (get) put that in perspective:
It's 52 away from 100. So it makes sense to go up to the nearest multiple of 100. Now, let's think about 137.
It's 4, plus 12 plus 12. So, it's 4 plus 24, that's gonna be 28. Well, that doesn't meet our perimeter constraint.
So 3 goes into 42 14 times So this right over here simplifies to 14 And it all checks out
So you just have to say, if you're sitting in this plane right here, this plane to the left.
So when we're thinking about proportional relationships, that means that y is going to be equal to some constant times x.
-9(-1), well that's positive 9, and then -7(7) is negative 49 so it's 9 - 49, which is equal to which is equal too which is equal tooo which is equal toooo which is equal toooo! negative 40.
2x is equal to 16, divide both sides by 2, we get x is equal to 8. Now let's do this situation.
We could write 0.8 plus 1.2x is equal to 0.8. You subtract 0.8 from both sides. You get 1.2x is equal to 0. x has got to be equal to 0.
2 times 3 is 6.
14 minus 12 is 2. Bring down the 4. 3 goes into 24 eight times.
Nope, not a perfect square. So 216, let's just keep going.
If I divide 7 times x by 7, what am I going to be left with? If I divide that by 7, what am I going to be left with?
Cause we have a six right here, so we round up so if you care about significant figures, this is going to become a 3.7. And I want to be clear.
If you have 0 months, you pay nothing. Then one month, $40, the next month another $40 getting you to $80. So if I were to write this as an equation, the dependent variable here is the amount that I pay in dollars.
Our finishing position is 4, 2.
Four goes into 70, 1 time, subtract get 30, 7 times, multiply, subtract, get a 2 over here as your remainder. So it is not divisible by 4, Now let's move on to five.
In the green room I received my uniform. It was not the kind of outfit that I normally wear, but it was far from the Michelin Man suit that I had anticipated. Not bad, really.
Well, 100 deciliters, each of them is going to be worth 10 centiliters, so that's going to be 1,000 centiliters.
Well, you could say 10 liters is equal to 1 dekaliter.
Microorganisms are small. So small you can't even see them unless they cluster together. Each of these dots is really millions of bacteria.
I just subtracted the three, I subtracted the two from the three to get one and I kept the denominator the same. Which makes sense. If I have three out of the seven pieces of a pie, and I were to give away two out of the seven pieces of a pie,
We're told to list in order from smallest to largest.
Now that we have a decent understanding of how to figure out many significant figures that we are dealing with lets take a situation where, significant figures will or might become relevant. So let's say that I have a carpet here and I'm using a may be a meter stick to measure the carpet to nearest centimeter.
Let's do another problem. And actually, if we wanna check it we could say that the original problem was 2x plus 3 equals minus 15.
So just doing this little simple, smelly soap example, we've got a very interesting result. 3 divided by 2 is the same thing as 3 times 1/2, which is the same thing as 3/2.
12 over 5 times 5 over 12, the 12's cancel out, the 5's cancel out, and you're left with just an x. So you get x is equal to 2/3 times 12 over 5.
And the first thing we can do, we can actually get rid of these parentheses right here, because we have this whole expression, and then we're adding it to this whole expression. The parentheses really don't change our order of operations here. So let me just rewrite it once without the parentheses.
Now lets go to point F. To the left of point F there is no other point.
So he went 82-1/2 miles in 1.5 hours. So let's figure out what this is. And I'll have to do a little bit of decimal long division to do this.
So for example, if we had the expression if we had the expression. x to the y power, if x is equal to 5, and y is equal to 2 y is equal to 2. then our expression here is going to evaluate to -
So this second expression can be written as minus 6 times the square root of 16 times the square root of 2. This right here-- I want to be clear-- is the same thing as the square root of 16 times 2. You can separate out.
We already know that 9 times 8 is 72 and we just write the 72 right down here. And we're done!
Then they say 12 years ago, William, William was 84 years old. They say that he is 7 times as old as Ben.
5 times 7. Same thing. You could write them in parentheses.
Hello, I'm now going to do some practice least common multiple problems for you. After I do a couple of these problems you should be able to go to the least common multiple module and do some of them yourselves. Let's say the least common multiple of 10 and 8.
Our slope is going to be-- let me write this-- slope is going to be equal to change in x-- sorry, change in y. I'll never forget that. Change in y over change in x.
If someone tells you what y and z is, then that constrains what x is. If someone tells you what x and y are, then that constrains what z is. But it depends on what the different things are.
The absolute value of 5 is the distance of 5 from 0. So you go 1,2,3,4,5, 5 is exactly 5 to the right of 0. So the absolute value of 5 is just 5.
Those are always factors [Sal] Let me write those:
One way to think about it is that they are both 8 away from 0. This is 8 to the left of 0 and this 8 to the right of 0. So both of these things evaluate to 8.
And it looks like 27 is roughly 30.
5x - 2x is equal to 3x. And if you really think about what that means. 5 "x's" are just: x + x + x + x + x.
Well you say well, 2 times 2 that equals 4. And it turns out that if you have a negative times a negative, that that equals a positive. So let's write that first rule down.
Notice I'm not saying that the $one hundred is growing by twenty-five percent. I'm saying that I start with some amount of money, it grows by twenty-five percent, and I end up with $one hundred after it grew by twenty-five percent. To solve this one, we might have to break out a little bit of algebra.
So let's think about 5.
(Laughter) But it turns out, I jumped on a plane, and I ended up walking a red carpet between Sarah Silverman and Jimmy Fallon and Martha Stewart. And I went onstage to accept a Webby award for Best Blog.
Since 1986, it hasn't leaked. This technology, the women will not share with the men.
So we're essentially multiplying by 4. And you even see it here.
So you see this 5 minus 2 right there? We're going to do that first no matter what.
And you might say so how do you know to multiply it by a 1000 instead of divide by a 1000? One way to think about it and this is probably the best way to think about it is a kilometer is a huge bunch of meters, its actually 1000 meters. So if I am converting kilometers into meters
The first term is 3x squared, The second term it's being added to -8x. You might say wait, isn't it minus 8x?
So 78 divided by 0.15 is exactly 520. So x is equal to 520. So 78 is 15% of 520.
Do we round up to 200, or do we round down to 100? Well, if we're rounding to the nearest 100, we want to look at one place to the right of that. We want to look at the tens place to decide which multiple of 100 it is closer to.
55 is the distance. The time is 1 hour.
They'll recognize that, and say, you know, I'm going to stop growing a little bit. That's called contact inhibition.
For every 3 hours of computer games, Sandy has 2 hours of homework. For every 7 hours of computer games, Madison has 4 hours of homework. I can say they have to do a number, a certain number of homework for every amount of computer games they play.
I'd like to talk about what I call our warehouses for hope. Cameroon, northern Cameroon, boom and bust cycles of hunger every year for decades. Food aid coming in every year when people are starving during the lean seasons.
[Green is the new black ...] (Laughter) (Applause) I like that, too. Anyway, I know Chris told us not to do pitches up here, but since I have all of your attention:
109.25. Notice how easy I made this for you to read, especially this two here.
So now the problem has resulted in 141 - 9.
So this says two thousand, nine hundred, forty and three. Now we can re-write each of these things as thousands, hundreds, tens as the sum of one plus something that is divisible by nine. So, a thousand, I can re-write as one plus nine-hundred ninety nine.
The following table of values represents points x comma y on the graph of a linear function. Determine the y-intercept of this graph.
- and let me finish my sentence - you are very likely to help select for antibiotic-resistant bacteria. Now how does that work? Now let's say this is a green
So two plus two is four. Four plus two is equal to six. Now that's only one way to think about it.
(Laughter) (Applause)
When I was a young researcher, doctoral student, my first year, I had a research professor who said to us, "Here's the thing, if you cannot measure it, it does not exist." And I thought he was just sweet-talking me.
So now we're talking about a situation where our length is 10 inches. So 10 inches, 10 inches. So we get 10 inches, 10 inches.
(Laughter) In the '80s here, you have Bangladesh still among the African countries. But now, Bangladesh -- it's a miracle that happens in the '80s: the imams start to promote family planning.
5 times 5 is 5 multiplied by itself two times. This is the same thing as 5 to the second power. So if we want to write our answer using exponential notation, we could say this is equal to 3 times 5 to the second power, which is the same thing as 5 times 5.
Well, 5 times 7 is 35. This goes 5 times. 5 times 7 is 35.
Let's see, if you add 4, you get to 60, and you have to add the 10. So then you get to 70. And it looks like we have found one of these numbers.
9/60 is the same thing if we divide the numerator and the denominator by 3, is the same thing as 3/20. So we could write this as 9 and 3/20.
In this situation right here we have a mixed number where 5 is the whole number and 1/4 is a proper fraction as numerator is less than denominator So write as an improper fraction I will show you the methodology
Ah! Cranberry sauce à la Bart! Just stick it in the refridgerator when you're done, Bart.
9 times 3 is 27. Subtract, and you're done. It goes in perfectly.
They notice that this ratio is closer to 3.1.
So c is 5/16 plus 5/12. Our denominators are not the same. We have to find a common denominator, which has to be the least common-- it actually could be any common multiple of these, but for simplicity let's do the
So let me take the square root of 216.
60% - roughly 60% of the Serbian army is killed. And even from a population point of view, the Serbian population is reduced by 16%. 16% of the Serbian population - civilian and military - is dead by the end of World War I.
7 times 8 is 56. You subtract.
This is 4 feet wide. It is 8 feet-- they say it's 7 feet high. It's 4 feet long.
Squeeze coins together.
So that means that I have eight groups-- forty divided by five --I have eight groups of five students. Now we're wondering how many girls there are. So each group is going to have three girls.
I could write divide by 3 or multiply by 1/3. Actually, let me write divide by 3. Let me write divide by 3 for now.
Let's see if we can identify what the common multiples are. Well, immediately I see that 10 times 4 is 40 and 8 times 5 is also 40, so that's a common multiple. If we keep going we see that 10 times 8 is 80 and 8 times 10 is also 80.
162 inches.
2 times 8 is 16, minus 5 gives 11. So the absolute value of 11 is 11, we know that's true. It all works out.
In the summer of 1963, 250,000 people showed up on the mall in Washington to hear Dr. King speak.
So square root of 45, so the square root of 45, or the principle root of 45. 45 is not a, 45 is not a perfect square. It's definitely not a perfect square.
The area is 26 times 30 square inches, which is equal to-- let's actually multiply this one out-- 26 times 30.
We have 7 times 10 to the fifth over 2 times 10 to the negative 2 times 2.5 times 10 to the ninth. So let's try to simplify this a little bit.
In the last situation we just kept adding 10% of the original $100.
6 and 9 are both divisible by 3. So let's divide them both by 3 so we can simplify this fraction.
So times twenty-three. So you start off doing this problem exactly the way you would have done it if there was just a three down here. You can kind of ignore the two for a little bit.
You get 2 times 0, which is 0, minus 3 and 1/4.
Put the one up here. And I got rid of the previous one because that would've just messed me up. Now I have two times three.
440 equals 4 times 84, we just saw that, is 320 plus 16 is 336.
Let s be the set of all integers that can be written as n squared plus 1, where n is a non zero integer. n is greater than zero, and it is an integer. It is a non zero integer.
And of course 1.3 minus 0.7 is 0.6 times x of my somethings is equal to 12. And now, this looks just like one of the problems we did in the last video. We have a coefficient times x is equal to some other number.
I've got three rectangles here, and I also have their dimensions. I have their height and their width.
So we could say, well, when x is equal to 5, y is equal to 2. Or, when y equals 2, we have k times 5, or k is equal to-- dividing both sides by 5, you can't see that. If I divide both sides by 5, I'm left with k is equal to 2/5.
could either list out the first four exams that I took. Or I already know what the average is. So I know the sum of the first four exams is going to 4 times 84.
And 15 plus 35 is definitely 50.
This is 11.7. And the way we've drawn our number line, we are increasing as we go to the right. 11.7 is to the right of 11.5.
7, 6, 5, 2, 4, 4. And then you count how many digits there were between the leading digit, and I guess, you could imagine, the first decimal sign.
And 79 plus 3 is 82, so this is equal to 82. That's if you just evaluate it the way that they gave it to us. Now, the associative law of addition tells us it doesn't matter whether we add 77 and 2 first or whether we add 2 and 3 first.
So if I were to rotate it like that. Stand it on this side, so this would be point A This would be point D.
And the way we do these problems, we move the decimal point here one over to the right. So we just get a two and then we can move the decimal point here one over to the right. So this 0.2 goes into 4 the same number of times that two goes into forty.
So let's do the ninety right there.
11 minus 11 is 0. So you're going to be with left with just an x is equal to 7 minus 11. Now what's 7 minus 11?
Well, 2 times 7 is 14, and we have the same sign here, so it's a positive 14 -- normally you wouldn't have to write the positive but that makes it a little bit more explicit.
So the exponent of this first term term is 2, it's being raised to the second power, the exponent of the second term, remember -8x, x is the same thing as x to the first power, so the exponent here is 1, and on this last term, we already said this is 7 is the same thing as 7x to the zero, so the exponent here on the constant term, on 7, is 0, so these are, these things right over here, those are our exponents, exponents. And we are done.
violent to each other, hating each other as deeply as possible.
Ghanaian girl, Nigerian girl, Ethiopian girl standing on this TED stage. And maybe, just maybe, saying,
It is not 5 or greater, so I will round down.
Well, 3/4 is less than 1, so 3/2 is definitely greater than 3/4. And we can just pick greater than right over there.
Six plus zero is six. Five plus two is seven. Two plus three is five.
We can evaluate what 8 plus 3 is.
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. So we need to move it to 3 of those 4 sections.
The new numerator, or the numerator of the product, is just the product of the two numerators, or your new top number is a product of the other two top numbers.
We are asked to divide 99.061 or ninety nine and sixty one thousandths by 100. And there is a few ways to do it but all I'm going to do in this video is focus on kind of a faster way to think about it. And hopefully it will make sense to you.
This was 3/4 right there. So that is 3/4. This area in this purple color is 1/2 of the 3/4.
Now let's think about 7. Let's think about 7 here.
The perimeter is the distance you need to go to go around the square.
So times 2 times 2 times 2. This is going to give us positive 8. And you probably see a pattern here.
But this is just general terminology for different types of angles: less than 90 degrees you have an acute angle, at 90 degrees you have a right angle, larger than 90 degrees you have an obtuse angle, and if you get all the way to 180 degrees, your angle actually forms a line.
Well 9 - 2 is really 900 - 200. You're going to be left with 700. Then 71 - 8
So he needs to run 2 miles. How do we convert that to yards? Well, I don't have it memorized how many yards there are per mile, but I do have it memorized how many feet there are per mile.
5 times 9 minus 4. So it's 5 times 5. 5 times 5 is just 25, so we get the same answer either way.
So you add 1, you become -2 But if you add another 1 (which we have to do), you become -1. You move 2 to the right.
5 times 2 is eventually going to be the numerator. So let's divide the numerator by 2, so this will become a 1. Let's divide the denominator by 2.
This right here is what the third term looked like, and then we added another column of four blocks right here. So we added four more, so we're going to have 13 blocks.
And the more you go on sharing,
So if this is greater than or equal to 5, 5 or greater, you round up. If it's less than 5, you round down. 2 is definitely less than 5, so we just round down, so it is 423,000.
So 27000 is equal to 2^3 times 3^3 times 5^3.
In 40 years, Imran is going to be x plus 40. (Plus this 40 right over here.) But they give us another piece of information!
We're told to make a table and solve. So they tell us that we have 50 ounces of a 25% saline solution, a mixture of water and salt.
2 minus 5x has to be less than 7 and greater than 12, less than or equal to 7 and greater than negative 12, so and 2 minus 5x has to be less than or equal to 7. So let's just solve this the way we solve everything. Let's get this 2 onto the left-hand side here.
So we have 1.5 goes into 82.5. Let's multiply both of these numbers by 10, essentially shift their decimals one over, so shift that decimal over here. So it becomes 15 goes into 825 how many times?
I can go I can go right left that is one dimension; or I can go up down And so this surface of the monitor you're looking at
Since we have three digits that are repeating, we want to think about a thousand x, 10 to the 3rd power times x and that will let us shift it just right so that the repeating parts can cancel out. so 1,000x is going to be equal to what? We're going to shift the decimal to the right, 1, 2, 3... so it' s going to be 3,257 point... and then the 257 keeps repeating:
So, our greatest common divisor of 10 and 7, so let me write that down, so we have 10 We want to think about, what is our GCD of 10 and 7 And there's two ways that you can approach this
In the last video, we saw that air, when we breathe in, when our diaphragm contracts and makes our lungs expand and fill up that space, air comes in. Air comes in and that air that comes in is going to be-- as we're breathing atmospheric air-- it's going to be 21% oxygen and it's going to be 78% nitrogen. And actually, in our atmosphere, carbon dioxide is actually almost a trace gas.
So if I have to factor 2x squared plus 7x plus 3, it's going to be 2x plus something times x plus something. Because 2x times the x is 2x squared. And the b times the a is going to be equal to 3.
4 is a factor and then I can and I've probably
So I'm going to choose to get the x's on the left. So let's bring that sevenx onto the left. And we can do that by subtracting sevenx from both sides.
Well, you have 3 left over, and that comes from right over there. That is the remainder when you divide 4 into 7. 3 left over, but it's 3 of your 4, or 3/4 left over.
And on the right-hand side minus 11 plus 24, well that's 13 and we still have over 3.
1 2/3. And then this right here, this 1/3. That's another 1/3, so that's 2/3, and then that's 1 right there.
We could rewrite 18/6. Let me make the sixths that same orange color. That's going to be the same thing.
These 3 minus 3 is 0, and you see that here. We're just left with 2Ys right over here, and on the right-hand side, we got rid of 3 of the blocks. So we only have 4 of them left.
So all we did is we divided by 4 and then multiplied by 4, which doesn't change the actual value. Or you could think of it as we undistributed a 4. We factored out a 4.
0 is considered a whole number, but if x were 0, it would not be a member of the natural numbers. So we can't say it's natural. All we can say is, that it's definitely integers, it's definitely rational.
Now, let's get rid of this negative 3 from the left-hand side. So on the left-hand side, we only have x terms, and on the right-hand side, we only have constant terms.
Carry the 1.
5 times 15.
We know that 2 times 2 is 4. But here we have a negative times a positive 2, and it turns out that when you multiply a negative times a positive you get a negative. So that's another rule.
I just swapped the order, you could say negative 9/4 is less than y. Or if you want to visualize that a little bit better, 9/4 is 2 and 1/4, so we could also say y is greater than negative 2 and 1/4 if we want to put it as a mixed number. And if we wanted to graph it on the number line-- let me draw a number line right here, a real simple one.
So f has us doing 7/27 minus 9/39. All right, so what is the common denominator here?
Well, 36 - 15.. 6 - 5 is 1, 30 - 10 is 20.. So it's going to be 21 So Beth's distance is 21 kilometers...
So, let's say we want to multiply 50 times 7. And I encourage you to pause the video and think about it yourself and then unpause and see what I do. So 50...
It becomes 60,000. So this becomes a 6. And then we're regrouping that into the thousands place.
So we're gonna add 6y+2 Then we're gonna add the negative two thirds minus y We're gonna add the negative two thirds minus y
So 9 and 3/20 is the exact same thing as 9 and 15/100. These are all equivalent answers.
And the F is the Fahrenheit temperature.
Write six hundred forty-five million five hundred eighty-four thousand four hundred sixty-two in standard form. So let's tackle this piece by piece.
And of course, a net of 7 is much better than 0. It's greater than 0, and so that one also works.
The prime factorization of 30, we already figured out, is equal to 2 &amp;times; 3 &amp;times; 5 So what's the most number of prime factors that they have in common? Well, these two both have a 3 and they both have a 5
And then negative 2/3 times 3 is negative 2. And now to get it in slope intercept form, we just have to add the 6 to both sides so we get rid of it on the left-hand side, so let's add 6 to both sides of this equation.
So to that ninety-five dollars, I'm going to add another fifteen percent of ninety-five.
Times our change in time So this is -9.8 divided by 2, so it's -4.9 m/s squared, times delta t squared And then we can subtract 10 from both sides and write this into a traditional quadratic equation form
So you'd say, this is 5 times 10, which is equal to 50. And we know that that's the right answer.
0 times 11 is 0. you're left with a remainder of 10. So 11 goes into 20 ten times with a remainder of 10. It definitely does not go in evenly.
The next smallest number looks like 135, which was 3/4. And then the next one is going to be the 144/180, which was 4/5. Next is 156/180, which was 13/15.
-1 to the third power is equal to -1 time-1 times -1, which is equal to -1 So the cube root of -1 is -1 So it becomes -1 times, times this business right here
Fractions to Decimals Write 7/8 as a decimal. And so the main realization here is that 7/8 is the same thing as 7 divided by 8, which is the same thing as 7 divided by 8.
(Laughter) Well, she didn't say that exactly.
So Elbert is equal to 44/48 the size of Mont Blanc. Let's write B for Mount Blanc. They also tell us Mont Blanc is 4,800 meters high.
17 and 2/9 is the exact same thing as 17 plus 2/9, and then 5 and 1/9 is the exact same thing as 5 plus 1/9, so 17 and 2/9 plus 5 and 1/9 is the same thing as 17 plus 2/9 plus 5 plus 1/9.
And we are given the base of ADC.
The square root of 0.16. Now you could do this in your head if you immediately recognize that, gee, if I multiply 0.4 times 0.4, I'll get this.
What is 4 times 9 km? Well, this is essentially 9 + 9 + 9 + 9, so we could just add up the 9's.. 9 plus 9 is 18, plus 9 is 27, plus 9 is 36.. So he ran a total of 36 km.
That's where t is equal to b. And so r of a will be this vector right here that ends at that point. And then as t or if you can imagine the parameter being time, it doesn't have to be time, but that's a convenient one to visualize.
Well to go from 13 to 65, you have to multiply by 5. 5 × 10 is 50 and 5 × 3 is 15. Right.
We add what I got on the fifth exam, and then we divide it by 5, because now we're averaging five exams. And I said that I need to get in an 88 in the class. And now we solve for x.
And if we look at it, it's only 4 away from 49 and it's 9 away, it's 9 away from 36.
So we get vf squared is equal to 2 times the force divided by the mass times the distance. And then we could take the square root of both sides if we want, and we get the final velocity of this block, at this point, is going to be equal to the square root of 2 times force times distance divided by mass. And so that's how we could figure it out.
That is 2 times 9 plus 3. That's the 2 times 12, which is also equals 24. So it all works out. x is equals to 9.
(Laughter) So we can see a lot happening in data in the coming years. We will be able to look at income distributions in completely new ways.
So that's one base angle, that's the other base angle. This is an upside down isosceles triangle, this is a right-side-up one. And so, if these two are the same then these are also going to be the same.
500 minus 200 is 300. And then 40 minus 24 is 16. 316.
So I'm starting with $95.00, and I'll get rid of the dollar sign.
Now, let me draw 17 objects here. So 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17. Now, these two things are equal, so anything you do to this side, you have to do to that side.
We have 0.8 liters of sugar in Drink A, and when you add this amount to it, you still have 0.8 liters of actual sugar in Drink C. So this thing has to be equal to zero. We could set up an equation here.
here, this will be times, 10 to the 23rd, times 10 to the minus 22. You just add the exponents. You get times 10 to the first power times 10.
4 times 3 is 12. And now we have the same denominator. We are ready to add.
You get x is equal to 4, and you get that exact same thing over here.
So if we have 50 houses, well, we can use the pattern that we came up with. It's going to be equal to, starting with our 6, the first house requires 6. And then we're going to add 5 for each incremental house, so plus 5 for each incremental house.
8 5ths and raise it to the positive 2 power. So all of these statements are equivalent, and that would have applied even when you're dealing with non-fractions as your base right over here. So 2 you could say, well, this is gonna be the same thing, 2 to the negative 4 is going to be the same thing as taking my reciprocal.
And a person who has not loved himself, how can he love the neighbor? From where can he get love?
Let's say I start at A and I wanna go to D But I wanna I want the option of keep on I wanna keep on going
Well, that equals seven times seven, right, that's seven squared, times and now let's do seven to the fourth. Seven times seven times seven times seven. Well now we're multiplying seven by itself six times, so that equals seven to the sixth.
So it equals seven to the forty-fifth. Now I want you to think about that, does that make sense? Well, we could have rewritten this equation as seven to the fortieth times seven to the fifth, right?
So, we will subtract 6 from both sides 18 minus 6 is 12
[Unintelligible] obvious, similarities between prehistoric horse fossils and modern day horses, as well as between dinosaurs and birds though nobody really bought his insights into the resemblance between birds and dinosaurs for another 100 years.
78 is 15% of what number? So there's some unknown number out there, and if we take 15% of that number, we will get 78. So let's just call that unknown number x.
So I literally do 4 times 5 plus 1, which is-- so this is equal to 4 times 5 is 20, plus 1 is 21, and then that's over 4, so it's 21/4. And all of this is kind of a fast way to do it. We're literally doing the exact same thing that we did here in kind of a slower way.
("Intrigue and murder among 16th century Ottoman court painters.") (Laughter)
Or another way of thinking about it, he's going to pay 25% is the same thing as 0.25.
So it's 2 times--instead of 2 times y-- we can write 2(x+4).
And 1962, there was really a group of countries here that was industrialized countries, and they had small families and long lives. And these were the developing countries: they had large families and they had relatively short lives. Now, what has happened since 1962?
Now is 4/6 and 2/3 the same thing? Well, he has 3 equal sections. I had 6.
A total of one time 1 times 4 is 4. And then what is our remainder?
"I tried. And I made it." So I would like to say something to all the people out there like me to the Africans, and the poor who are struggling with your dreams.
Negative 1 to the 0 power is 1.
(Laughter) And then I said, "It's bad, right?" And she said, "It's neither good nor bad."
5 times 5 times 5 times 5 times 5 times 5 times 5. That's seven, right? One, two, three, four, five, six, seven.
If we multiply this times 7, times 7, we get 7 times 1, and then we have one, two, three, four, five, six numbers behind the decimal point.
So, they're telling us that 30% of that [number] are the emperor penguins - which is 15. So they're saying, if we take 30% -
The answer to the question is hard for me because, on the one hand, I think that we should feel really great about the fact that the Republican nominee -- certain nominee --
This is a number...I feel like, I can just kind of add numbers. They're representing some type of quantity. While this over here is representing a chunk of text.
We all worry about our privacy settings on Facebook, but the fact of the matter is, our openness can be used against us. Terrorists are doing this. A search engine can determine who shall live and who shall die.
If y is 0 and z is -1, it's going to be 0 + (-1). These can all be evaluated and they'll essentially give you a value depending on the values of each of these variables that make up the expression. In an equation, you're essentially setting expressions to be equal to each other.
Well, the best way to get rid of a plus 5, or of a positive 5, is to subtract 5. So, let's subtract 5, but remember this says "a plus 5 is equal to 54". If we want the equality to still hold, anything we do to the left hand side of this equation we have to do to the right side of the equation.
We got eight hundred twenty-eight. And you could expand it even more like we did in the previous video.
And the original amount that I borrowed in fancy banker or finance terminology is just called principal. So in this case the rent on the money or the interest was $10. And if I wanted to do it as a percentage, I would say 10 over the principal-- over 100-- which is equal to 10%.
What is the smallest number that both 15 and 9 go into?
I'll try to color code it negative three and then another negative three or you could say negative three minus three or, and this is the interesting thing, instead of over here there's a two times positive three you added two, three times. But since here is two times negative three you could also imagine you are going to subtract two, three times So instead of up here, I could written two plus two plus two because this is a positive two right over here, but since we're doing this over negative three we could imagine subtracting two, three times, so this would be subtracting two (repeated) subtract another two right over here, subtract another two and then you subtract another two notice you did it, once again, you did it three times, so this is a negative three, so essentially you are subtracting two, three times.
Well, we get p, 15 divided by 5 is 3. So Paulette lives 3 miles from school. And you see that.
It is 10 to the left of 0. That's what the absolute value is telling us. Then we have the absolute value of zero.
[Sounds of robots whirring and kids reacting to their successes and failures] STUDENT ABOVE THE NOlSE: Go!
We are adding 10 to it. So we're going to move 10 to the right. If we move 7 to the right we get back to 0, and then we're going to go another 3 after that.
And then the 4/6, that's the same thing as 2/3. So this becomes 3x plus 2 times 13 which is 26/3, is equal to 13.
Let's also multiply the numerator by 10. 7 times 10 is 70, or 70 over 100. It's the exact same thing as 7/10.
These human traits developed gradually over millions of years. The fossil record reveals a long and eventful parade of human ancestors. Doing some periods, several of our ancestors coexisted.
Well, it could be less than 7 and 1/2 and greater than 0, or equal to 0. So let me put it this way. So h could be less than 7 and 1/2.
We would round up to 1,590.
When you're subtracting 8 you're subtracting another 6.
10 plus 4 in parentheses plus 3, and then they have something plus 4 plus 3. So it looks like they're wanting us to realize that it doesn't matter if we do the 10 plus 4 first or whether we do the 4 plus 3 first. So if we just took this statement right over here and changed the parentheses so that we add the 4 plus 3 first-- so they're doing here-- this number right over here could be the 10.
And now, we've already written it as a fraction and if we want we can simplify this down.
So here it's between the one and the tenths place. So we could write it as 2 ones. And 1 tenth.
So the equation, how y varies with x, is y is equal to 2.25x, where x is the number of gallons we purchase. y is the cost of that purchase, so it's $2.25 a gallon. And then they ask us, how many gallons could you purchase for $18?
When y is equal to 0, this expression up here becomes 0 plus 0 (our y here is going to be zero)... (We'll do it in that same blue color.) .... plus 0 plus -7. Now, if you add 0 to anything it's not going to change the value. So this thing over here, this is pretty straight-forward, these don't matter
Let's try to evaluate seven and six-ninths minus three and two-fifths. So like always I like to separate out the whole number parts from the fractional parts. This is the same thing as seven plus six-ninths minus three minus two-fifth.
1 + 2 is equal to 3. So this is divisible by 3. This right over here, let's add up the digits!
It turns out of this is equal to 2 to the hundredth power times 9 to the hundredth power. Now let's make sure that that makes sense. Let's do it with a smaller example.
We have uploaded UNAlDS data on the Gapminder site. And we hope that when we act on global problems in the future we will not only have the heart, we will not only have the money, but we will also use the brain. Thank you very much.
The Karman line is the point at which the Earth's atmosphere ends and outer space begins. The Karman line is at 62 miles above sea level.
You get 207, and then you bring down the 9.
The total concentrations: by 2025, they will be essentially where we were in 1985. If the wealthy countries were completely missing from the picture, we would still have this crisis. But we have given to the developing countries the technologies and the ways of thinking that are creating the crisis.
I multiply 3 by 1 to get 3. And then 3 times 9 is 27. And so it is 2, (I'm adding here), 8 plus 3 is 11, carry/regroup the one, 1 plus 1 is two, 2 plus 7 is 9, and then I have a two here.
20 goes into 100 five (5) times.
How many 0's does the quotient 5,700,000 divided by 10 to the third power have?
"The Good Earth" is about Chinese peasant life. That's just not convenient for propaganda. Got it.
So we're going to want to do the parentheses first. We have parentheses there and there. Now this parentheses is pretty straightforward.
What's neat about this technique is that we don't have to regroup. We're just going to start with the hundreds place and keep on moving. So, for example, if I think of 301, I first want to subtract 100.
Well then you say - Well look, If I took 217 and divided it by 217 that would get me to one and dividing by 217 is the exact same thing as multiplying by one-over-217 multiplying by its multiplicative inverse which is, once again, a word that is fancier than the actual concept you are just multiplying by the inverse of this number Another way to think about it is if I have five things and I take one fifth of those things, how many things do I have? Well, if I take one fifth of five things I have exactly one thing right over here
(Applause) And we women are going to lead the way in this new revolution, this new feminist issue. We are literally going to sleep our way to the top, literally.
4 I can re-write because I'm going to have to add 4 to negative 14/3. So I want a common denominator. 4 is the same thing as 12/3,
1 minus 2 is negative 1. And then we're going to want to square our negative 1, so that will be equal to positive 1.
Now, if you didn't immediately recognize that 16 goes into both 48 and 64, you could do it step by step. So let's say we started off with 48/64. Now, the key thing to remember with any fraction, whatever you do to the numerator, you have to do to the denominator.
So we could write that p, which is how far Paulette's house is from school, times 5, is equal to how far Jessica's house is from school. Jessica's house is 5 times as far from school as Paulette's house. p is Paulette's house's distance from school. j is Jessica's house's distance from school. They then tell us that Jessica's house is 15 miles from school.
that's the pyloric sphincter.
We'll see what happens after some time. One day, as I was just browsing on the Internet I came across a newspaper article which stated that during the Gulf War, there was an accidental oil spillage in Southern Kuwait because of which tons of oil was spilled over the Persian Gulf which led to the death of thousands of migratory birds that visit the Persian Gulf every year.
Let's see if we can write 0.15 as a fraction. So the important thing here is to look at what place these digits are in. So this 1 right over here, this is in the tenths place.
What is 0 times negative 12? Well, you might say that the signs are different, but 0 is actually neither positive nor negative. And 0 times anything is still 0.
Today, I'm going to take you through glimpses of about eight of my projects, done in collaboration with Danish artist Soren Pors.
And every time you would see a y, you would put an 8 in its place - - in this context. We're setting these variables to specific numbers.
We have 7329 - 6278. So let's go place by place, and see if we can subtract.
1 + 0 + 0 + 7 =8, + 6 = 14 + 5 = 19 So 19 is not divisible by 3. So this one we're not gonna write a three by there.
20 minus 30 is equal to negative 10. And that is the correct interpretation of that. So I want to make something very, very, very clear: if you have things at the same level so if you have 1 + 2 - 3 + 4 - 1 so addition and subtraction are at the same level in order of operations - you should go left-to-right.
So, let's subtract, let's subtract 7 from both sides. And we get on the lefthand side... 2x plus 7 minus 7 is just 2x. Is greater than 3 minus 7 which is negative 4.
Well that equals three times four-- order of operations, you always do multiplication first, and that's actually the way I taught it-- how to convert this, anyway. three times four is twelve plus two is fourteen. So that equals fourteen over three. Let's do another one.
You know that 10 to the 0 is 1. Let's start there.
So if you think about when you multiply 7 times 4, you're getting the area of this entire rectangle, which we just did up here. But we want to know the area of the triangle.
6 times 1 is 6, plus 3 is 9. So 6 times 16 is 96. You have this divided by 1 here, but that's not going to change anything.
Your personal ancestry story begins with a shared story of our human ancestry.
So H1-N1 could be a potential combination. Maybe H3-N2 and so on.
So 4 plus the quantity of 2 times that expression. It's gonna be 4 plus some quantity. 4 plus the quantity of output of that parentheses.
Bring down a zero.
Regroup the 3.
I think this is becoming obvious to you.
Now, I like to get all my x terms on the left-hand side, so let's subtract 8x from both sides of this equation.
24,249 is going to be sitting right over here someplace, so it's going to be closer to 24,200.
This 4 by 4, you get 1. So now when you multiply it, you get 9 times 1, which is 9, over 1 times 7, which is 7. So we have our answer, but right now, it's an improper fraction.
I'll just leave it like this. dx/dt times dt. I could make these cancel out, but I'll just write it like this first. Times the unit vector i plus dy/dt times dt.
And let's see, 18 divided by 9 is 2, 9 divided by 9 is 1. That simplifies pretty nicely into 8. So 18 divided by 2.25 is 8, so we can buy 8 gallons for $18.
Now, we want to group all the x terms on one side of the equation, and all of the constant terms-- the negative 3 and the positive 18 on the other side-- I like to always have my x terms on the left-hand side, if I can. You don't have to have them on the left, so let's do that. So if I want all my x terms on the left, I have to get rid of this 12x from the right.
Write 7/4 as a mixed number. So right now it's an improper fraction.
Without understanding the nature of life.
1948 was a great year: the war was over, Sweden topped the medal table at the Winter Olympics, and I was born. But the differences between the countries of the world was wider than ever.
So 1 plus-- or actually, let me do it the way I tend to think of it. What I do is I take 4 times 5. So let me write that down and I want to color code it.
And you have a z to the fifth. And then, finally, this last term, it's a constant term. How many factors does it have?
And I said, "I'm just thinking about it a little bit." (Laughter) She said, "You're like the worst vulnerability role model ever."
According to the pictograph below, how many survey respondents have type O positive blood ? How many have O negative blood ? So pictograph is really just a way of representing data with pictures that are somehow related to the data
8 goes into 12-- it doesn't go into 1, so it goes into 12 one time.
So we could say that fivex-- thirty-five less than eight hundred. thirty less than eight hundred gets seven hundred and seventy.
So if I take 343 and if I want to divide it by 7, 7 goes into 30-- it doesn't go into 3-- 7 goes into 34 four times.
Let me think. three times x plus five is equal to eight times x plus two. Well, we do the same thing here. Although now we have two expressions we want to get out of the denominators.
you falling cop copyrighted program and pride and edited into the program not primed moan and all non and gone and and and and them and and and and and weighed one hundred and my mom there on the mainland
And forty-five divided by three, forty-five divided by three is fifteen. Four and four-fifteen, so actually we're done! These two can't be simplified anymore.
So let's find all of the x's that satisfy this. So the first thing I'd like to do is get rid of this 3. So let's subtract 3 from both sides of this equation.
1 times 8 is 8. Subtract there.
Find all of the factors of 120. Or another way to think about it, find all of the whole numbers that 120 is divisible by. So the first one, that's maybe obvious.
You see the 8/8 is the same thing as a whole. Now, you see, you could make another whole out of 1/2, plus 3/8, plus 1/8, and they add up to a whole. And just to make sense of why that worked, 1/2 is the same thing as 4/8-- because you see that, we filled in the 4/8-- then you have 3/8, and then you have 1/8.
3 goes into 12 four times.
And we're breaking them into groups of eleven. And every group will have the same number of boys and of girls.
And so this simplifies to-- I'll do it step by step. Once you get the hang of it, you can do multiple steps at once. So this is going to be 7 plus 3 times the 5 minus 2, which is 3.
So if I have a rectangle, let's say the rectangle is 1/2 by 1/2 by 2. Those are its dimensions. Well, you could just multiply it.
By the time your question is complete,
So this is literally going to be 3000 + 400 + 30 + 9 or 3439. Now how would you do it if you didn't wanted to write it down like that? And this is where you'll see a kind of shorthand notation, this is often called Borrowing.
So, we can take 10 from the 10s place (And this becomes a 90.)  and give that 10 to the 1s place.
So if I start off with $95.00 and my portfolio grows-- or the amount of money I have-- grows by fifteen percent, I'll end up with $109.25.
And this red line, every time the x axis increases by 3 which means 3 more hours of computer games, it increases by 2. So there's 2 more hours of homework. This red, this red line describes the relationship between computer games, hours of computer games and hours of homework for Sandy.
Announcer: Magic is the only honest profession. A magician promises to deceive you -- and he does.
The first thing I say is: "OK, well you can't serve yourself; you've got to serve others something of value. Because that's the way people really get rich."
And then finally, DA a or AD, however you want to call it, is going to be the same length as BC, which is 5 again. So plus 5 again. So you have 7 plus 5 is 12 plus 7 plus 5 is 12 again.
So this 9-- get a new color here. This 9 is not in the tenths, the hundredths. It's in the thousandths place.
So you see, depending on what the values of these are - (And we could even do more complex things.) We could have an expression like "the square root of x + y and then minus x" ... like that.
So now lets get back to the differences between individual virus types.
Just gather courage.
I have one, two, three, four, five, six. So 10 to the minus 6 is going to be equal to point, and we're going to have six places behind the decimal point, and the last point is going to be, or the last place is going to be a 1. So you're going to have five 0's and a 1.
As long distance transportation gets easier and easier, and individual societies become more diverse, languages are being lost, and genetic distinctions across the globe are fading.
I encourage you to pause the video and try it yourself using the same technique.
like--oh, actually there are no improper fractions here. Actually, let's do it that way. Let's convert to an improper fraction and then convert that into a decimal.
400, 4,000, and 40,000 dollars. So down here, is poor and sick, and up here is rich and healthy.
This is our end product of digestion and feces is going to pass out through the anus. The longer the feces sits in the large intestine, the drier it's going to get because water is being absorbed and some solutes are also being absorbed in that tube. The food we eat is going to be chewed up in the mouth and swallowed in the form of a bolus.
We know what 7 times 4 is. We already know it's 28 centimeters -- we did that up there. So this right here is 28 centimeters.
156 nations carry our television channel. Our magazines are read by millions. And what we're doing is a series of journeys to the ethnosphere where we're going to take our audience to places of such cultural wonder that they cannot help but come away dazzled by what they have seen, and hopefully, therefore, embrace gradually, one by one, the central revelation of anthropology: that this world deserves to exist in a diverse way, that we can find a way to live in a truly multicultural, pluralistic world where all of the wisdom of all peoples can contribute to our collective well-being.
So, 21 and 30 are the two numbers that we care about So we wanna figure out the greatest common divisor, and I could have written "greatest common factor," of 21 and 30 Once again, there's two ways of doing this
Same type of situation. x squared minus z squared over xz minus 2x times z minus x. x is equal to negative 1, z is equal to 3. Let's do our substitutions. So this is x squared.
I started a site called TreeHugger --
-10 = -11, no It is not true. So x = -1 &amp; y=7 does not satisfy the second equation.
And we can essentially do the same thing here. If we want to isolate the 3x, we can subtract five from both sides, subtract five from both sides, we get negative twenty-one.
I'm now going to do a few classic problems that show up a lot at math competetions and sometimes on standardized tests, and they seem like very daunting and intimidating problems, but hopefully over the course of this video, you'll realize that if you kind of see what they're asking for, it's really not that bad. So let's try this first one right over here. They tell us a a + a + b a + b + a + b + c a + b + c = a + b + c = 7 and then they ask us, what is 5a 5a + 5a + 5 5a + 5b 5a + 5b + 5a + 5b + 5 5a + 5b + 5c equal to?
It's not that a coconut fell on my head, and I came upon this idea.
CD with a line over it Would've refer to the same line segment
Well, we literally could view it as 8 groups of 1. So let's do that. So 8 groups of 1 would look like this:
So times 2 times 2 is going to be equal to 4. And we've seen this before.
to be replaced from time to time.. With this new method we save these costs and less cumbersome. Day time we use what is required by us and give the balance to the utility.
So we want to figure out what 150 divided by 0.25 is. And we've done this before. When you divide by a decimal, what you can do is you can make the number that you're dividing into the other number, you can turn this into a whole number by essentially shifting the decimal two to the right.
In the last video, we made a visual argument as to why this expression has to be less than 1/3, and this expression we already figured out is the fraction that are bears. Now we will make an algebraic argument, or I could call it an analytic argument.
And on the right-hand side, we have 3 thousands. So that's this right over here. That's the 3 thousands.
If we just multiply the numbers 2 times 5,280. So what is that going to be? Maybe I should get a calculator out.
150 people lived there, worked there.
Write 14,897 in expanded form. Let me just rewrite the number, and I'll color code it, and that way, we can keep track of our digits. So we have 14,000.
93 goes into 170? Goes into it one time.
(Music) Give it another try.
We learned that thirty-six times three was one hundred eight. And when you added them together we got what?
(Applause) Thank you. Thank you.
Is essentially saying that x has to be between negative 10 and 10 and it can't be either negative 10 or 10. We're not, there's no equals sign here. So, the same exact logic.
So let's divide both of them by 3. 6 divided by 3 is 2, and 9 divided by 3 is 3. So 21/28 is 3/4.
So it can't be equal to 40, because if x is equal to 40, 40 minus 5 is 35.
What about 51? Is 51 prime? And if you are interested you can pause the video here and try to figure out by yourself if 51 is a prime number.
And I encourage you to pause this video and try to compute this expression on your own. Well, the thing that jumps out at you is that these are in different formats. This is a percentage.
So this right here is 11. This right here would be 12. And then let me draw the tenths.
You have been always afraid and now it is going to happen!
Let's do a few more examples from the orders of magnitude exercise. Earth is approximately 1 times 10 to the seventh meters in diameter.
Or that x is equal to 3 divided by 0.09.
If we were to do 12 times 3 times 10, if we just wrote it like this without parentheses, if we just went left to right, that would essentially be exactly what we just did here on the left. But the associative law of multiplication says, you know what?
The speed of light is 3 times 10 to the eighth meters per second. So as you can tell, light is very fast. 3 times 10 to the eighth meters per second.
Let's added 2/3 x, so plus 2/3 x to both sides of this equation. I'm doing that so it I don't have this 2/3 x on the right-hand side, this negative 2/3 x. So the left-hand side of the equation-- I scrunched it up a
So, two to the third times two to the fifth. Well there's one way that I think you do know how to do it. You could figure out that two to the third is eight, and that two to the fifth is thirty-two.
If the absoulte value of 2x minus 5 is equal to 11 that means that the stuff inside the absolute value sign either equals 11 or the stuff inside the absolute value sign is equal to NEGATlVE 11. Because if this is equal to 11, the absolute value of 11 is 11, If this thing over here is equal to negative 11, when you take its absolute value it'll still be equal to 11.
And then we can multiply both sides of this equation by negative 1, and we get y is equal to 7. So we found the y value of the point of intersection of these two lines. y is equal to 7. Let me write over here, so I don't have to keep scrolling down and back up. y is equal to 7.
1990, you've gotten most of the northern areas. And more recently you can see it's just around the equator.
If we want to figure out time in the air, we know that displacement is equal to the initial velocity times time-- let me write change in time, that's technically more correct plus acceleration times change in time squared over two Now in our situation, we know what our initial velocity is
I could go to 500, 600, so on and so forth. Now, let's start with 152.
And then 1/4, if we put 12 in the denominator, 4 times 3 is 12. 1 times 3 is 3. 3/12 and 1/4 are the same thing.
(Laughter) Not exactly Jackie Collins.
So this is going to be equal to, well, the least common multiple of 3 and 100. And they share no common factor, so it's really just going to be the product of 3 and 100-- the least common multiple is 300. So it's going to be something over 300 plus something over 300.
2 times x, plus 2 times 3, which is 6. Now what I like to do is get all of my constant terms on the same side of the equation and all my variable terms on the same side of the equation. So let's see if we can get rid of this 2x term on the right hand side.
In this video, I want to introduce you to the idea of a list, of a list in python. It is one of the most powerful data structures in Python, and it really is just a sequence of a bunch of other stuff. So a list in Python would look something like this:
Of course, the only thing I could say at that point was, "Yeah, me neither. Yeah -- me neither."
Let's draw a number line. So if we have 0 here, and we want all the numbers that are less than 12 away from 0, well, you could go all the way to positive 12, and you could go all the way to negative 12.
Let's do some problems with the distributive property. And the distributive property just essentially reminds us that if we have, let's say, a times b plus c, and then we need to multiply a times this, we have to multiply a times both of these numbers.
So let's put a decimal place right over here and let's throw some 0's over there.
"Geo" comes from Greek for "Earth".
When you take 3 to the negative 1 power, we saw on the last video that that's equal to 1 over 3 to the first power, or 1/3 .
So x is equal to time playing Bologna Man. I'll write Bologna right here. And let's define y as y is equal to the number of minutes they spend playing You Have to Cut the Wire.
The important thing you need to realize, though, when you do it with an inequality is that when you multiply or divide both sides of the equation by a negative number, you swap the inequality. you swap the inequality Think of it this way. I'll do a simple example here.
We are asked to find the cube root of -512 Or another way to think about it is if I have some number and it is equal to the cube root of -512 This just means if I take that number and I raise it to the to the third power then I get -512.
Ax plus By is equal to C, if I want to do something to this equation, I just have to add the same thing to both sides of the equation. So I could, for example, I could add D to both sides of the equation.
So, it's 50 feet away We want to figure out the time it'll take to travel at 50 feet Once again, we would want it in seconds so we would want seconds per feet
Put a zero down there. three times four is twelve, carry the one. three times six is eighteen.
Well, the minus 7 disappears, because negative 7 plus 7.
We know that quadrilateral ABCD over here is a parallelogram.
How about with other humans? 99.5% So, what makes us different, from one another?
lets try 7 number 7 is a natural number, whole number any natural is a whole number any natural and whole number si an integer so 7 is also a integer. any number that is natural, whole and integer is a rational number. we can write 7 as 7/1 we can write any integer as that number / 1 if it is rational it cannot be irrational. it is also going to be real we have -15. it is not a natural number natural number are positive integers only it is not a whole number it is an integer, it is the opposite of +15 it is rational as it can be written as -15/1 and because it is rational it cannot be irrational it is also real.
(Laughter) (Applause) Those mosquitos are not infected.
We're asked to identify the percent, amount, and base in this problem.
Now, to go from 12 to 60, we have to multiply the denominator by 5, so we also have to multiply the numerator by 5, so 1 times 5 is 5. 5/60 is the same thing as 1/12. To go from 5 to 60 in the denominator, we have to multiply by 12, so we have to do the same thing for the numerator.
I could say fourteen divided by five is the same thing as fourteen divided by-- this sign right here-- divided by five. And what you do is you say, well, let's see.
So this is going to be equal to-- well, we could divide the numerator and denominator by 2, so the 4 becomes a 2, the 2 becomes a 1. 5 times 2 is 10/1, So it's just 10. Part B.
We're saying x has to be less than 3 so it has to be in this shaded area right over there. This second constraint says that x has to be greater than 6. So if this is 6 over here, it says that x has to greater than 6.
Let's do the same thing with 245. If you haven't paused it and tried it yourself, once again, I want to emphasize. That'll make it really valuable for you to try it on your own.
Well, if we're ending here and we started here, let's just, let's just do ending point minus starting point. So it is x one minus x naught, and that way doing it this way I would have made sure that I have a positive value.
(Laughter) We all sit at various places at various times on this scale, but what the law of diffusion of innovation tells us is that if you want mass-market success or mass-market acceptance of an idea, you cannot have it until you achieve this tipping point between 15 and 18 percent market penetration, and then the system tips. I love asking businesses, "What's your conversion on new business?"
These were four guys on the L.A. Rams in the 1960s you did not want to go up against. They were tough football players doing what they love, which was crushing skulls and separating shoulders on the football field. But Rosey Grier also had another passion.
(Applause) Now, moving on to our second ingredient, that is bird feathers.
27/2 feet, we're going to multiply it by 12 to get the number of inches. Since this is going to be times 12, and we'll make sure the dimensions work out: 12 inches per foot.
Now, the next thing I want to do, just because dealing with fractions are a bit of a pain, is multiply both sides of this inequality by some quantity that'll eliminate the fractions. And the easiest one I can think of is multiply both sides by 3. That'll get rid of the 3's in the denominator.
That's just going to make people come and rob me. So I'm a third entrepreneur and I see an opportunity for business and I call that business a bank. And so what is a bank going to do?
Will do that part that's a whole number part and then we have plus plus twelve sixteenth - let me do this in pink maybe - plus twelve sixteenth minus eight sixteenth minus eight over sixteen.
8 times 8 is 64. When you subtract, 70 minus 64 is 6. You still have a remainder, so let's keep going.
Since 2007 every other month the city closes down the busiest streets for traffic and converts it into a playground for children and childhood. Here was a city telling its child, "You can." A glimpse of infection in Ahmedabad.
Let's say I start off with some amount of money, and after a year, let's says my portfolio grows twenty-five percent, and after growing twenty-five percent, I now have $one hundred. How much did I originally have?
So if you're at E away or closer, you're going to be pulled inside. But we want to think about safe distances.
And of course, the academic, insecure part of me was like, "You're going to call me a what?" And she said, "I'm going to call you a storyteller." And I was like, "Why not 'magic pixie'?"
12 is 2 times 6.
9 minus 96. Well let's see.
So that works and negative 10 has to work for this one as well.
Just remember complementary means two angles add up to 90 degrees, supplementary means that two angles add up to 180 degrees.
Well, the y-value is 4.
So 150 divided by 0.25 is the same thing as 15,000 divided by 25. And let's just work it out really fast.
If you have 1 over something, you can get rid of the 1 over, and put a negative in front of the exponent.
You should have success then. Look at TiVo. From the time TiVo came out about eight or nine years ago to this current day, they are the single highest-quality product on the market, hands down, there is no dispute.
The base angles in the first case are angles YXZ = angle YZX in the second case the angle XYZ = angle YXZ we said that all sides are equal to each other. If we have a triangle with all 3 angles at 60 degrees then all 3 sides will be the same
So if I said negative 4 times positive 3, well 4 times 3 is 12, and we have a negative and a positive.
Seven times seven is forty-nine. Plus four is fifty-three. Stick a zero here.
9 divided by 3 is 3.
We get fivex minus eighty-five is equal to tenx minus eight hundred and fifty. And then you get-- and I'm going to do this, skip some steps, just to confuse you-- fivex is equal too-- well, I think I just confused myself. fivex is equal to eight hundred and fifty minus eighty-five.
DEF. and then finally angle BCA, which is that angle over there, corresponds, we look at the three bars, corresponds to angle EFD. Now when we think about corresponding sides.
So seven hundred and sixty-five.
Both of these are less than 0, so I'll put 0 all the way over here. Maybe 0, 1, 2. Let's go negative, negative 1, negative 2, negative 3, negative 4, negative 5, negative 6.
So we have 9 times 60 is 540. We subtract. We have 9 left over.
This is the letter SHeen, and it makes the sound we think of as SH -- "sh."
And so this simplifies things a good bit. Now we have 237 minus 100 is going to be 137. So it equals 137 in the numerator over 300.
Zero is considered to be divisible by two so this is going to be divisible by two. Another way to think about it is is if you have an even number over here, and Zero is considered an even number, then you're going to be divisible by two. So over here,
Write 5 and 1/4 as an improper fraction. An improper fraction is just a pure fraction where the numerator is greater than the denominator. This right here, it's not a pure fraction.
So times, let's say it's 7.23 times 10 to the minus 22. So this is some really small number. You're going to have a decimal, and then you're going to have twenty-one 0's then you're going to have a 7 and a 2 and a 3.
We just add the numerators, three plus two is five, and we keep the denominators the same.
So then how many times does 15 go into 78? So let's think about it.
(Laughter) So here's one last thing I'd like to mention. I learned that when I made small, sustainable changes, things I could keep doing, they were more likely to stick.
So 30/45, what's the largest factor of both 30 and 45?
Identify which of the following numbers are integers and then plot them on the number line
So minus 5x plus, you have a minus 5x. These cancel out.
8 times 7 is 56, so that'll work. So it goes into 60 seven times.
By what number can we multiply 4,850 to get 1? Well, we've already done this.
(Laughter) So, there you have some free advice from one of the most beautiful women on earth. No grunting, no coughing, no wheezing, no talking to yourselves, no farting.
7 plus 9 is 16.
But 354 is also closer to 400 than it is to 300. It's 54 away from 300. It's 46 away from 400.
It equals sixty seconds. Right? And this part can be confusing, but it's always good to just take a step back and think about what I'm doing.
12 minus 8 is 4.
Now there's a book actually, about KlPP -- the place that this is going on -- that Jay Matthews, a news reporter, wrote -- called, "Work Hard, Be Nice." And I thought it was so fantastic. It gave you a sense of what a good teacher does.
So this line is going to look like this. Do my best to draw it, that's a decent job. That is line A right there.
Congruent triangles are a subset of that So, everything thats congruent is similar. Two triangles are congruent to each other are going to be similar to each other
And when we subtract, 190 - 162 is going to get us - Actually, we could've had another 27 in there. Because when we subtract -
100% percent is more than 80. It's actually 1 and 1/4 of 80, and you see that right over there, so it makes sense. It's 125%.
Let's say I have 3 chairs.
Let's let M be equal to number of apples at Maple Farms. And then who's the other guy? River Orchards.
My change in y over change in x is equal to negative 4 over negative 6. The negatives cancel out and what's 4 over 6? Well, that's just 2 over 3.
There's a couple of ways you could do it. You could multiply in your head 28 times 10, which would be 280, and then subtract 28 from that, which would be what? 252.
2 goes into 10, so we go 2 goes into 10 five times.
Well, 2.5 is the same thing as 2 and 1/2, which is the same thing as 5/2, so it's choice B. Next problem.
Six minus five is one. Two minus one is one, and then you have five minus nothing. So, he is left with five hundred eleven dollars and eighty-two cents, after his second deposit.
So we can write 3/4 as something over 12. And we can write 2/3 as something over 12. And I got the 12 by multiplying 3 times 4.
And then if I were to group the blue strips into groups of 2, then I would have 1, 2 of them that have actually been colored blue. So if I divide both the numerator and the denominator by 2, I get 2/3, which is the exact same fraction as Micah. Another way to think about it, is if you divide each of Micah's sections into 2.
So how far is 0 from 0? Well, it's 0 away from 0.
You and your distant cousin, the chimpanzee, had a common ancestor, which lived about 6 and 1/2 million years ago. We can learn about this common ancestor by noting what makes us similar to chimps. But many things also distinguish us from chimpanzees,
A candy machine creates small chocolate wafers in the shape of circular discs. The Diameter of each wafer is 16 millimeters. Whats it the area of each candy?
So if we say that, S is the "Number of Sessions per Month" and C is the "Monthly Cost" How can we express the trial plan as an equation?
In '85, '86, I was in Bangladesh advising the government and the research council there how to help scientists work on the lands, on the fields of the poor people, and how to develop research technologies, which are based on the knowledge of the people. I came back in '86.
So we could make, if you look at the 64, that is a 16, that is a 16, that is a 16, and then that is another 16. These should all be the same length. I drew it a little bit off.
So it's 1746 And you might say, Sal why did you go through the trouble of figuring out this and this? And I'm just using these as some of the approximation tools when we try to figure out how many times 291 goes through this whole crazy mess
This side over here AC, it corresponds to, well its the only one that is left but it's also opposite that two bar angle.
5 to the 17th would be even a way, way more massive number. But anyway, that's a review of exponents. Let's get a little bit steeped in algebra, using exponents.
"Oh god, what if it has impact on the baby?" Because I have heard that pregnant women are not supposed be seeing ugly things, things that disturb them. I myself, conform to the idea that
This video is 30 seconds long what's that? It's 30 seconds long We don't have time to get along because it's 30 seconds long
We get 3/5 m plus-- Well, let's see, this is the same thing as 1/10, right? Let me write that way. So 1/10 times 3/5 is 3/50.
There's No Tomorrow
Now to figure this out, we just have to figure out whether these are equivalent fractions, and the easiest way to do that, is to put both of them in simplified form, and see if we get the same answer. So let's try with 3/12 first. So if we have 3/12, both the numerator and the denominator are divisible by 3.
5/4 is literally the same thing as 5 divided by 4, so let's figure out what that is. Let me do it in magenta.
They would eat three of the four pieces. They would eat three of the four. So this is one piece, this is two pieces, and this is three pieces.
Negative sixteen is less than or equal to three x plus five which is less than or equal to twenty. And the other way is to think of it as two separate inequalities but both of them need to be true.
So we have negative 3y plus 2y. Now, let's think about-- and I'm just going in an arbitrary order, but since our next term is an xy term-- let's think about all of the xy terms. So we have plus 4xy right over here.
"more than 90 percent." Now, the skeptics say, "Oh, wait a minute, this could be variations in this energy coming in from the sun." If that were true, the stratosphere would be heated as well as the lower atmosphere, if it's more coming in.
So let's divide both the numerator and the denominator by 8. And if we do that, 8 goes into 28 three times.
If I said 4 to the 1/2 power right there, this means this is equivalent to the square root of 4. Which is equal to, if we're taking the principal root, this is equal to 2. So if I were to take, let's be clear, 8 to the 1/3 power, this is taking the cube root of 8.
(Chaplin sound) Thomas Henry Huxley was the father of comparative anatomy and the father of modern palaeontology and he invented the word agnostic to describe his spiritual views and he was the first person to conclude that birds evolved from small carnivorous dinosaurs.
Alright let me re-write a little bit closer to the center. So,it doesn't get too spread out. On the left hand side, I got 2X plus a mass of Y. That's the total mass.
Does 3 go into 75?
26 divided by 13 is 2. And that is our answer. That is our answer.
We want to do the square root of 32.
Three times negative two should give us the same result. It's going to be equal to negative six.
So, -3 + 2 is -1. And you can see for yourself, this all fits our traditional notion of adding and subtracting.
What is fourteen divided by five?
Add the blue and pink expressions to create another expression And be sure to combine like terms! So let me get this scratchpad out here
Now, we do the same thing over here. 36, 12 times 3, so we're multiplying 12 by 3 to get 36.
And the coefficient's negative six. So we multiply both sides of the equation by negative one / six.
Well, 1 decigram is equal to-- no, sorry. 1 gram is equal to how many decigrams?
3 times 8 is 24, plus 1 is 25. So this thing over here is the same thing as 25 over 3. Let me just rewrite the whole thing.
And what else does the problem say? It says, in how many years would take for Salman to be exactly-- I should put that in another color for emphasis-- Exactly four times as old as Jonathan?
What is minus 16 divided by 8?
So 25 does not go into 1.
I'd like to begin with a thought experiment. Imagine that it's 4,000 years into the future. Civilization as we know it has ceased to exist -- no books, no electronic devices, no Facebook or Twitter.
And, of course, 5x minus 3 is equal to that. Now, I think you know how I like to operate. I like to get all of my ex-coeffients on one side.
When you are sharing, the question is of sharing, it is not with whom. Whomever it may concern, you simply give.
10 million is if I wanted really just one digit to represent it, if I were write this in scientific notation. This right over here is 1.271543 times 10 to the seventh. Let me write that down.
10 + 1 is 11. So notice, I did the exact borrowing  the exact regrouping  that I did here. I just represented it a little bit differently.
A thermometer in a science lab displays the temperature in both Celsius and Fahrenheit. If the mercury in the thermometer rises to 56 degrees Fahrenheit, what is the corresponding Celsius termperature? And then they give us the two formulas - if we know the Celsius temperature, how do we figure out the Fahrenheit temperature, or if we know the Fahrenheit temperature how do we figure out the Celsius temperature.
What we have got over here is a triangle where all 3 sides have the same length. All 3 sides are congruent, a triangle like this, we call as equilateral triangle Now what i want to do is to prove that if all 3 sides are the same then all all 3 angles will measure the same
"It was a fricking spiritual awakening."
Let's think about exponents with ones and zeroes. So let's take the number 1, and let's raise it to the eighth power.
0 х 20 is 0. (0 х 20 = 0). And then 13 - 0 = 13.
Does this make sense, that 18/6 should be equal to 3? Well, we could rewrite it.
So when we went from the first term to the second term, what happened?
You would've gotten 1.8. So 30% of 6 is equal to 1.8. And we can verify it doing this way as well.
1, 2, 3. So it's going to be 2.81 times 10 to the negative 1, 2, 3 power. Let's do one more like that.
Negative sixteen is less than or equal to three x plus five which is less than or equal to twenty. And really there's two ways to approach it which are really the same way and I'll do both of them. And I'll actually do both of them simultaneously.
So if I wanted to convert two and one half into an improper fraction, or I want to unmix it you could say, all I do is I take the denominator in the fraction part, multiply it by the whole number, and add the numerator. So let's do that. I think if we do enough examples, you'll get the pattern.
0 minus 13 is indeed negative 13. So it works. Actually I forgot to check this one over here.
And so we get, this is 5 times 7 is 35 over 66. And that's in lowest common form or simplified form. So E.
And I'm going to give that 10 to the one's place so 10 plus 8 is 18.
I say to you: don't consider anybody else in the world, just consider yourself; and in that very consideration you will have considered the whole world. In being selfish you will find all the altruism that you have been seeking and seeking and not finding,
Especially here in Washington, if you try to make a breakfast date, and you say, "How about eight o'clock?" they're likely to tell you, "Eight o'clock is too late for me, but that's okay, I can get a game of tennis in and do a few conference calls and meet you at eight." And they think that means that they are so incredibly busy and productive, but the truth is they're not, because we, at the moment, have had brilliant leaders in business, in finance, in politics, making terrible decisions. So a high I.Q. does not mean that you're a good leader, because the essence of leadership is being able to see the iceberg before it hits the Titanic.
Well, the best way to figure out which of these have the same area or perimeter as this original yellow rectangle is to just figure out the area and the perimeter for all of these rectangles and see which ones of them are equivalent. So we already know the area for this one, but we, we don't know its perimeter, so how do we figure that out? Well, to figure out perimeter we would need to know the lengths of all the sides.
So one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve. Let's divide it into groups of three. And I'm going to make them a little strange looking just so you see that you don't always have to do it into nice, clean columns.
Model B need to be pink to make that happen? It would be four.
If they just asked us which number of tiles is more than you need, more than enough, then maybe this would have been OK. But they're saying exactly enough. This is actually too many small tiles here, so I'm not going to check that one.
75 minus 68 is 7.
It currently has 9 rows, each with an equal number of seats. We see that - 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 rows. How many total seats will it have, if it adds 2 seats per row?
Well, for the area, I just have to multiply the length times the width.
(Laughter) So, I went to the Museum of Natural History, and I checked out the bones, and I went to the gift shop, and I bought a book.
You had them up and you get eight, four, one plus nine is ten. Carry the one. You get two.
70 plus 11 is going to be - I have eighty - I have 81 seats. I now have 9 rows, with 9 seats each, which gets me 81 total.
We're asked to evaluate the expression a squared plus ten b minus eight when a is equal to seven and b is equal to negative four. So to evaluate the expression we really just need to substitute a with 7 and substitute b with negative 4. Because they are saying evaluate it when a is seven and b is negative four.
So we can rewrite this as the distance Paulette's house is from school times 5, which we know to be Jessica's distance from school, or Jessica's house's distance from school, which we now know to be 15, is going to be equal to 15. So what would p be? Some number times 5 is going to be equal to 15.
So the product of negative 8 and that expression is gonna be negative 8 times that expression. That expression is negative 5 plus 4X.
A recipe for banana oat muffins calls for 3/4 of a cup of old-fashioned oats. You are making 1/2 of the recipe. How much oats should you use?
So 2 times 34 is 68. Now, if you do 34 times 2, 2 times 4 is 8, 2 times 3 is 6. That's why it's always nicer to write the number with more digits on top.
And let me do it one more time.
180/12 = 15. Same for numerator, 15.
And once again, try to pause the video and do it on your own. So I don't have any hundreds to subtract, so I can immediately go to 72 - 8 - which is really 720 - 80.
Subtract a Z is the same thing as subtracting 1z the word 1z strikes a part of my brain because I have very young children but that's a different type of 1z and then you can see yeah you definetly did add the two coefficients
2007 was a great year. I graduated from school, and I went on a road trip with two of my closest friends. Here's a picture of me and my friend, Chris, on the coast of the Pacific Ocean.
Nidalee is about to play a game at the county fair. Dinner plates are mounted on a wall, and the goal is to break as many as possible by throwing a spear.
Can you do the cranberry sauce? Yeah! Where is it?
We could say 100 is 5/4 of 80, and we would be absolutely correct. But they want to say what percent? So we have to convert this to a percent, and the easiest thing to do is to first convert it into a decimal, so
So here we're asked, how many times larger is 7 times 10 to the fifth than 1 times 10 to the fourth? Well, we could just divide to think about that.
10 minus 2 is 8. 10 minus 2.3 is 7.7. So it's going to be 7.65.
Well, one doesn't even look like a fraction. But you can write it as a fraction. Well that's the same thing as one tenth minus-- how could we write one so it has the denominator of ten?
Take the quantity of negative 4 times x and add 9. That's this expression right over here. Now select the answer that matches the following-- the sum of 4 and the product of negative 9 and that expression.
Because we've zoomed in a bit, you can actually see that the brush border or the micro villi are actually made up of cells called enterosites.
Now, if it's x percent sugar here, or this is the decimal equivalent, that's x, how much sugar do we have? We have 1.2 liters times the decimal equivalent of sugar, so this is going to be 1.2 times x. Now let's think about it.
You could view this as the number 65 one time or you could view this as the number 1 sixty-five times, all added up. But either way, if you have one 65, this is literally just going to be 65.
And so when you go from 2 to the second power to 2 to the third, you're multiplying by 2 one more time. And this is another intuition of why something to the 0 power is equal to 1.
Now we mixed up things a little bit more: on the left side of the scale, not only do we have these identical unknown masses with mass X, these three blue things, we also have some of the 1kg masses over here, actually, we have two of them. Now, we are going to figure out wat X is. But before we even do that, I want you to think about a mathematical equation that can represent what is going on; that equates what we have on the left hand, with what we have on the right side of the scale.
That makes sense because we're essentially saying what's negative 4 times itself three times, so it's like negative 4 plus negative 4 plus negative 4, which is negative 12. If you've seen the video on adding and subtracting negative numbers, you probably should watch first. Let's do another one.
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20. But a quicker way is to say, well, we have five pies. Each of them have four pieces.
So let's watch a movement happen, start to finish, in under three minutes and dissect some lessons from it. First, of course you know, a leader needs the guts to stand out and be ridiculed. What he's doing is so easy to follow.
1 divided by negative 4. So this is the first equation, right over here, in slope-intercept form. Now let me write the second equation in slope-intercept form.
1945, it's still most places.
So if it was a thousand times 44, we would get 0 plus 0 is 0, 0 plus 0 is 0, 0 plus 0 is 0, 4 plus 0 is 4, 4 plus nothing is 4. And if you ignore the decimal, that makes a lot of sense. Because a thousand times 4 is 4000 and a thousand times 40 would be 40 000.
(Laughter) 2008 and 2009 were a little tougher. I know that they were tougher for a lot of people, not just me. First of all, the news was so heavy.
Evaluate the expression 5y to the 4th minus y squared when y is equal to 3 so every place you see a y here we can just replace it with a three to evaluate it so it becomes 5 times three to the fourth power minus three squared, all I did is every time we saw a y here, I put a three there so what does this evaluate to, we have to remember our order of operations remember parenthesis comes first, sometimes it's referred to as PEMDAS
3 plus 1 is equal to 4, and then you have your 1/8 over there: 4 and 1/8. I just wanted to give you that special circumstance when your fraction part ends up improper.
Let's give ourselves a little bit of practice with percentages. So let's ask ourselves, what percent of-- I don't know,
11 minus 7 is 4. Add our decimal place.
So 79 over 100 is the same thing. If I were to write it over 300, to go from 100 to 300 in the denominator, I'm multiplying by 3, so I have to multiply the numerator by 3 as well. So I'm going to multiply it by 3 as well.
So -40 is the very least, and you can view that as the least amount of money that you would want, out of these comparisons, in your bank account, or the smallest amount of money. You owe the bank $40. Not only do you have nothing, you owe the bank $40.
And if we wanted to write it in interval notation, it would be x is between negative 1 and 17, and it can also equal negative 1, so we put a bracket, and it can also equal 17.
8,085 times 9 is 72,765. Let's do one more example just to make sure that this is really clear in your brain. At least the process for doing this, and I also want you to think about why this works.
So 1.25 times x is equal to 100, so x would equal 100 divided by 1.25. I just realized you probably don't know what a hedge fund is. I invest in stocks for a living.
41, so 6.71 is a little bit greater. So let's, let me make it clear now.
It has to be something that is greater than 64. So I'm not going to include 64, but anything greater than that is completely cool. Now, what if I want to loosen things a little bit?
We have multiple lengths of time here, and they're measured in minutes. So what we want to do is say, well, what's an equivalent number of seconds? And so the first one is pretty straightforward.
10, 10.4 and the units are meters per second, meters, meters per second is equal to, is equal to my rate. Now, the next question, so we've got this in meters per second but unfortunately meters per second is, they're not the, you know, when we drive a car, we don't see the, the speedometer in meters per second, we see either kilometers per hour or miles per hour. So, the next task I, I have for you, is to express this speed, or this rate.
(Laughter) I meet all kinds of people who don't enjoy what they do. They simply go through their lives getting on with it.
So let's visualize 3/4. So he needs to practice 3/4 of an hour. So if this represents an entire hour, so let's divide it into fourths.
Chile will have a lower child mortality than Cuba within some few years from now. Here, we have high-income countries in the OECD. And we get the whole pattern here of the world, which is more or less like this.
We could actually try to-- actually, let's do this the old-fashioned way. Let's look at the factors. Let's look at the prime factorization of the two and then we could find the least common multiple.
But even these large magnets you deal with, the magnetic field is generated by the electron spins inside of it and by the actual magnetic fields generated by the electron motion around the protons. Well, I hope I'm not overwhelming you.
So it is not prime, technically, because it only has 1 as a factor; it does not have two factors.
one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven. So 3.2 times 10 to the 11th. So if we multiply these two things, this is equivalent to six
Well, 26 is clearly an even number, so it's going to be divisible by 2. We can rewrite it as 2 times 13. And then we're done.
So 72.1, if we multiplied it by 10 once, then we would move the decimal point over once. And we'd get 721, which makes sense.
4m plus 6m is 10m. 28 minus 24, that is equal to plus 4.
Well, that's gonna be 2 plus 48, which is 50. So, this doesn't meet our condition, that the perimeter is 20. So, let's cross that out.
And we could keep going on and on but we already have enough digits to round to the nearest thousand. This digit right over here is greater than this is greater than or equal to 5, so we will round up in the thousandths place. So if we round to the nearest thousandths, we can say that this is 0.76 and then this where we're going to round up, 762.
In fact, it's not divisible by 3, which means it's not divisible by 6 or 9. Doesn't even look to be divisible by 7. It might be a prime number.
So 9 goes into 17 one time.
I'm not focusing on influenza type C because this is much less common in humans and actually isn't even included in the annual vaccine.
And you divide 4g by 4, you get g. And you can't just only divide by 4. Then you then have to multiply by 4 in order to not change the actual value of the expressions.
5 times 60, 6 times 6 is 30, so 5 times 60 is 300. Subtract and we are done.
41 actually looks prime to me. So the final answer is 18 and 41/60.
Tarush was ten times as old as Arman. How old is Arman today? Let's see if we can tackle this quite interesting problem, I think.
So, 9 13th as a decimal is going to be what.
And she prefers to stay isolated in her home because that becomes a comfort, her safety. What Palash does is educate people like her. Imagine, she believes that she's not good enough now to socially participate.
And the times symbol and the X
And whenever you see this, one of the things that should immediately enter your mind when you see this in the SAT is, the sides of this triangle are the radius of the circle, right? It's the radius of the circle, right? Because every time it gets to the end point, and they actually it draw like that.
Let's figure out what eleven and twelve sixteenths minus five in eight sixteenths is. We might have to simplify it down to lowest terms. So the way I like to do these is the kind of separate out the whole number part of the mixed numbers from the fractional part.
Now, this all of a sudden becomes a lot more-- you know, we have a negative sign. We have a negative over here, but we're going to do the exact same thing. The first thing we want to do if we want to get the left-hand side simplified to just 7x is we want to get rid of this negative 2.
7 times 2 is 14. We're going to wait to do that addition. And then here we have a 16 divided by 4 times 2.
-- well, I guess it's either way. In this situation we're also saying that the difference between 5 and 12 is -7, but the numbers are that far apart, but now we're starting with the lower number. I think that last sentence just completely confused you, but we'll keep moving forward.
So this is the equation that describes the growth pattern. So let me write this, let me simplify this a little bit.
Well, to go from 20 to a 100 - (Forget the denominator.) To go from 20 to 100, you would multiply by 5. So let's multiply the numerator by 5, as well.
Well that's going to be the same thing as 5 minus 15 is negative 10. So it's the same thing as the absolute value of negative 10. Now, there's two ways you can think about it.
And 120 ends with a 0. If you end with a 0 or a 5, you are divisible by 5. So 5 definitely goes into it.
"Oh what a cute cuddly baby!" and maybe the dark child would be just wondering, "Ah, okay,
On the second term, we have -8 multiplying x, and we want to be clear-- the coefficient isn't just 8, it's -8, it's -8 that's multiplying x, so that's the coefficient right over here And here you might say, hey wait! Nothing is multiplying x here, I just have a 7 there is no x, 7 isn't being multiplied by x.
I believe it was in the 8th or 9th century I believe it was actually 820 A.D. when he wrote this book.
17 plus 5 is 22, so that part right there is 22. So we have 22 plus-- now what is 2/9 plus 1/9? Well, they have the same denominator, so it's going to be over 9, and then you add the numerators.
That's the exactly the same thing as five hundred twenty-six dollars and ninety cents, minus-- minus-- adding a negative is the same thing as subtracting a positive-- minus fifteen-point-oh-eight. --I will do this in another color-- Five hundred and twenty-six dollars and ninety cents, minus fifteen dollars and eight cents.
I still remember the day in school when our teacher told us that the world population had become three billion people, and that was in 1960. I'm going to talk now about how world population has changed from that year and into the future, but I will not use digital technology, as I've done during my first five TEDTalks. Instead, I have progressed, and I am, today, launching a brand new analog teaching technology that I picked up from IKEA: this box.
When x increases by 2, y decreases by 4.
And now we need to subtract our 25.
Not 4 years from now.
1, 2, 3. And we end up at positive 1. Now let's think about 2, so positive 2, and we're going to subtract a negative 3.
If you start at -1, right over here, and you subtract 2, you move 2 to the left.
So an acute angle will look something like that. I draw two rays coming from a common point. I could also -- so the acute angle could be this angle right over here.
4 times 4 [Sal] And I'll just write the 4 once
3 goes into 10 three times. Actually, this decimal point is right here.
Shame feels the same for men and women, but it's organized by gender. For women, the best example I can give you is Enjoli, the commercial.
If this angle is 135 degrees... So this magenta angle would be 360 - 135 degrees that's 225 degrees.
(Laughter) When I was five years old, my dad used to take me grocery shopping, and he would stare in wonder at the little stickers that are on the fruits and vegetables. He would say, "Look, can you believe they have a mango here from Mexico?
Tank volume. And from that, we want to subtract the metal box volume. So minus 4 foot by 8 feet by 7 feet.
Well, we multiply 1/2 times both of these. So it's going to be 1/2 x minus 1/2 y minus 4, and we're done. Let's do C.
25 over 20, if you divide them both by 5, this is equal to 5 over 4. x divided by x squared-- well, there's two ways you could think about it. That you could view as x to the negative 1. You have a first power here.
So dividing by 1/2 is the same thing as multiplying by 2. And you could think about it with other numbers, but hopefully, that gives you a little bit of an intuition.
(Applause) While all the brothers were busy just being hyper-connected 24/7, maybe a sister would have noticed the iceberg, because she would have woken up from a seven-and-a-half- or eight-hour sleep and have been able to see the big picture. So as we are facing all the multiple crises in our world at the moment, what is good for us on a personal level, what's going to bring more joy, gratitude, effectiveness in our lives and be the best for our own careers is also what is best for the world.
4 goes into 336.
I was here four years ago, and I remember, at the time, that the talks weren't put online. I think they were given to TEDsters in a box, a box set of DVDs, which they put on their shelves, where they are now.
So 5 times negative 3... 5 times negative 3 plus 7, let's see if it is greater than 3 times negative 3 plus 1. So this is negative 15 plus 7 is negative 8
So once again, this is equal to 6/5.
There was the first time you walked by the open door of a bakery and smelt the bakery air, or the first time you pulled a 20-dollar bill out of your old jacket pocket and said, "Found money." The last "A" is Authenticity. And for this one, I want to tell you a quick story.
So, we can write the absolute value of p minus 12 is less than 10 is saying that negative 10 is less than p minus 12 which is less than 10. And we can just solve this compound inequality all at once by isolating the p in the middle.
What would negative two times six plus negative six to be equal to. Well, six plus negative six is going to be zero. Negative two times zero, anything times zero, needs to be equal to zero, but then once again, we can distribute negative two times six so we get negative two times six, then plus negative two times negative six plus negative two times negative six, then once again all of this is going to be equal to zero, now based on the five experiment we just did, we said "well this needs to be equal to negative twelve" or we can view this as going to the six twice
So 1, 2, 3, 4, 5-- and you see it's going in the right direction-- 6, 7, and 8. So the area of this rectangle is, indeed, 8 square meters. And you could view this as 4 groups of 2.
So, there are a couple of ways we can do this. The way I like to think this, this term right here is in the ten-thousandths place, we can view this whole thing right over here as "727 ten-thousandths," cuz this is the smallest place, right over here. So let's just rewrite it.
Thirty-six times twenty we saw was seven hundred twenty.
"7" times "-5" is "-35". So, we simplified this part of it. Let's simplify the right hand side.
So this 9.564 becomes 9.6, or we can call this nine and six tenths. And then we're done!
Let's bring down a 0.
So you take 5 times 7 plus this numerator right here. So 7 is 35/5, then you have one more fifth, so you're going to have 35 plus 1, which is equal to 36/5. So this product is the exact same thing as taking the product of 7/4 times 36/5.
2006 was a great year. Under clear blue skies in July in the wine region of Ontario, I got married, surrounded by 150 family and friends.
3 times 5 times 10 to the eighth, times 10 to the eighth, times 10 to the second, times 10 to the second. And then we're going to have meters per second, so we could write meters per second. Time seconds, times seconds.
Let's say that I've got two Chuck Norrises (or maybe it's Chuck Norri) and to that I am going to add another three Chuck Norrises So I'm going to add another three Chuck Norrises And this might seem a little bit obvious but how many Chuck Norrises do I now have?
Eight times nine is seventy-two. Stick the seven up there. And then you have eight times nine again.
Somebody has come to a total chaos!
Remember, you can't add the 5 and the 3 because the 3 is just a constant term while the 5 is 5 times x.
In the last video on the lungs or the gas exchange in our bodies or on the pulmonary system, we left off with the alveolar sacs. Let me draw one right here. So we have these alveolar sacs that I talked about and they're in these little clumps like this.
So, wherever negative one is 'b' is going to be less than that. And the interviewer's very impressed, and she says "Look you've done very good reasoning here I think you deserve the job."
And it goes up at 5/4x. That's a little bit more than one. It's a 1.25x.
Because if we increase by 1 again, then it is indeed the case that y decreased by 2. And you see here when we increase x by 2, then y decreases at twice the rate.
So many of them are occluded by faces, and so on.
"Because of that Nobel laureate I'm here today." So I'm troubled when I see them like there's no hope.
6 goes into 12.
Find the sum 3 1/8 + 3/4 + ( -2 1/6) Let's just do the first part first, This is pretty straightforward.
'the year of our lord'
Well x is now going to be 5. x is going to be 5. y is going to be 2. it's going to be 5 to the second power. or it's going to evaluate to 25. If we change the values - If we said x - (Let me do it in that same color.)
So we say 1 plus 3 is 4. So let me write that.
16 times $3 which is the same thing as $48. And we are done.
In how many hours will the distance between the two planes be 1625 miles?
(Applause) Thank you.
15, and I don't recommend that you do this every time you do a problem because it'll take you a long time. But hey, if you ever get confused, it's better to take along time than to get it wrong. Let's think about another way of representing this, because I think different visual approaches appeal in different ways to different people.
So 1x minus 0.3x is going to be equal to 0.7x.
Kilometers, kilometers per hour. Kilometers per hour. So that's his average speed in kilometers per hour.
Let's think about what 6 times 1/4 is. Let me draw 1/4. Let's say that that is 1/4 right there, and
But I'll show you a more systematic way of doing it, if that wasn't obvious to you. So this is the same thing as the square root of 16/100, right? That's what 0.16 is.
There is less heat in the air at -3° than at -1°. It is colder---there is less temperature there. So let me just make it very clear:
If 75 wasn't divisible by 2, 25's not going to be divisible by 2 either. But maybe 25 is divisible by 3 again. So if you take the digits 2 plus 5, you get 7.
11 goes into 12 one time.
It has 7 in the hundredths place. So this is the hundredths place right over here. And then it also has nothing in the thousandths place.
But if this isn't eerie enough, they estimate-- so if this infects a cell in my nose or in my arm, as this cell experiences mitosis, all of its offspring-- but its offspring are genetically identical-- are going to have this viral DNA. And that might be fine, but at least my children won't get it. You know, at least it won't become part of my species.
It's like this -- I drew it smaller.
And we know from the multiplication module, 1/2 times 2/1, well, that's just equal to 2/2, or it's equal to 1. And that makes sense because, actually, any number divided by itself is equal to 1. 1/2 divided by 1/2 is 1, just like 5 divided by 5 is 1, just
Well, the crate volume-- if we do our math right, it should come out to 1/12 of this, because that's what we just figured out, is 5 times 1.5 times 2. So 5 times 1.5 times 2. Well, 1.5 times 2 is 3, times 5 is 15, so 15 cubic meters.
26 minus 14 is 12. So it checks out. We got the right answer for this equation. x is equal to 20.
Mary wants the fraction of pink blocks in Model B to be equivalent to the fraction of pink blocks in Model A. How many blocks in Model B need to be pink in order to make that happen? So let's look at Model A.
So 20/4 + 1/4 = 21/4 Another way to think is 5 x 4 = 20 + 1 = 21 So its 21/4
And I was inspired to study abroad after reading these. ["Complete Works of Sanmao" (aka Echo Chan)] ["Lessons From History" by Nan Huaijin]
Clearly, it is divisible by 1 and 24; in fact, 1 × 24 = 24. But it's also divisible by 2.
I dreamt of running around the garden with my two dogs. I wished that I'd get out of that wheel chair, and actually walk to my bathroom. I'd play a movie in my mind of all the things, that seemed completely impossible, in that one moment.
Let me write that. x plus x plus x plus x, which is equal to 4x, which is going to be equal to 36. They gave us that in the problem. And to solve this, 4 times something is 36, you could solve that probably in your head.
And we'll use j for a number of texts by J.T.
It is divisible by 1, 2, 3 and 6. So it has four natural number "factors", I guess you could say it that way
We're asked to simplify 9 squared. And that quantity, whatever 9 squared is, we know what it is, it's 81, but we'll keep it at 9 squared. They need to simplify 9 squared to the third power.
So 180 is 2 times 90, which is 2 times 45, which is 5 times 9.
This is a whole. So let me start on another whole.
So if you just had 7 plus 3 times 3, how would you evaluate it? Well, look back to your order of operations. We're inside the parentheses here, so inside of it there are no longer any parentheses.
16 times 9 times 3. Is that right? I'm using a different calculator.
"It has multiple functions." (Laughter) But, you see, there are things we're enthralled to in education.
So this is 7 times 10, which is equal to 70. So 7 times 10 to the fifth is 70 times larger than 1 times 10 to the fourth. Let's do one more.
So 4 times 0, well that's just 0. 4 times 0 is 0, we put that 0 in the tens place right over here. And then last, we have 4 times this 2 right over here.
So 3 times 10 is 30, and we still want to multiply the 12 times that. Now, what's 12 times 30? And we've seen this several times before.
5 times 5 is 25, carry the 2.
But if you remember PEMDAS, remember multiplication, division, same level. Addition and subtraction, also at the same level. So let's figure what the order of operations say that this should evaluate to.
The ratio 3 to 5 or 3 over 5 is the same thing as 12 to 20, is the same thing as 24 to 40, is the same thing as 48.
I'e got the person that I will spend my life with it. Well, we are both young and hopefully we will get along together well, because we need more experience. But I'm so happy to be here, I have only you here.
Well that's 3. And they have different signs, positive 9, negative 3. So different signs means a negative.
Nine times two, eighteen nine times three-- we actually know all of these.
And you could even get wider angles. If you go above 90 degrees... this could be, I don't know, 135 degrees If you ever want to really measure the angles you could use a protractor.
OSHO International Foundation presents Being in Love &amp; Sharing The Treasures I am teaching you to be selfish.
5 squared is the same thing as 5 times 5, which is equal to 25. So that right there is 25. And what's 3 to the fifth?
So if I say 7 to the zeroth power, What does that equal? And I'll tell you right now-- and this might seem very counterintuitive-- this is equal to 1, or 1 to the zeroth power is also equal to 1. Anything that the zeroth power, any non-zero number to the zero power is going to be equal to 1.
What is our y-intercept?
That would be too big over here We might want to do 873 again But this time we are going to do 873,000
If you go back to your 9th grade Geometry unit, you'd use the Side-Side-Side (SSS) theorem: if three sides are congruent, then the triangles themselves are congruent. That also means all of the angles in the triangle are congruent.
Let's do another problem. I'll type it in green this time.
And negative 2 plus 3, we've already seen it right over here,
Regroup the 4.
Eight, 9 this is negative 10. That should work, so lets try it out. So we have 3 times negative 10, 3 times negative 10 plus 7 should be less than 2 times negative 10.
And there's nothing I can multiply two by to get three. So I have to multiply both of them so they equal each other. It turns out that what we want for, what we'll call the common denominator, it turns out to be the least common multiple of two and three.
We can divide the numerator and denominator by 3, that's 4/5. What is 7/8 divided by 1/4?
The right-hand side, the 2.25's cancel out, you get x. And then what is 18 divided by 2.25?
And then they measure the radius of the circle right here or the diameter of that circle, and they'd say oh, the diameter looks like it's about 1. So they would say -- let me write this down.
So this is the last work, and a work in progress, and it's called "Space Filler." Well imagine a small cube that's about this big standing in front of you in the middle of the room, and as you approached it, it tried to intimidate you by growing into a cube that's twice its height and [eight] times its volume. And so this object is constantly expanding and contracting to create a dynamic with people moving around it -- almost like it were trying to conceal a secret within its seams or something.
So we can add the 4 marbles to the 5 marbles.
That's a mile not a meter.
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine times, right? Three times here and then another six times here. So we're multiplying 6 times itself nine times.
A 0 here, 7 times 1 is 7, 7 times 7 is 49, 7 times 6 is 42, plus 4 is 46. And then we have two zeros here, 6 times 1 is 6, 6 times 7 is 42.
We have 6 plus x minus 5 plus 7. Well, here there's actually no distributive property to even do. We can actually just remove the parentheses.
12 divided by 2 is 6, 2 divided by 2 is 1.
4 times 7 is 28. Subtract, 34 minus 28 is 6. Bring down a 3.
Let's learn a little bit about just how a plain vanilla bank works. So let's say that I'm an entrepreneur and I see a problem out there in the world. You have all of these hardworking people
It's the same thing as ten over ten, right? ten over ten is one. So one tenth minus ten over ten is the same thing as one minus ten-- remember, we only subtract the numerators, and we keep the denominator ten, and that equals negative nine over ten. one tenth minus one is equal to negative nine over ten.
Is 1 equal to 2 times 8 minus 7? Sorry, 2 times 4 minus 7. So 2 times this number, 2 times 4 minus 7.
The proteins and carbohydrates, so these are our carbohydrates and these are our proteins, and these guys are going to be absorbed directly into the bloodstream, into the capillary networks that sort of surround these central lacteals. There are carbohydrates going in, so you can see that this is how the small broken down particles of the food that we eat actually get into our bodies, get into our bloodstream. Next we're going to be looking at how are body uses those building blocks for either energy, for growth, or for storage in the human body.
That is minus 2 over 1, on both sides. The left hand side simplifies to x. The right hand side becomes minus 2 over 12, and we can simplify that to minus 1/6.
Twenty-three digits after the 6. What happens if I have, if I use this, if I try to get close to it with a power of 10. So what if I were to say 10 to the 23?
So it's going to be 237 minus 400 and minus 150 and-- this actually should be a plus right over here. This should be plus 450. And so let's see if we could simplify this a little bit.
10 to the minus 2 is equal to 1 over 10 squared, which is equal to 1 over 100, which is equal to 0.01 And I think you get the idea. Well let me just do one more so that you can get the idea.
So 6.4 times 3.2. Let's ignore the decimals for a second. We'll worry about that at the end.
It's more negative than negative two. It's negative two and then another negative one fourth. So it's negative two and then we go one fourth of the way to negative three.
Then the last part of the small intestine is called the ileum. Basically the small intestine is where big particles of food are broken down into their absorbable units and absorbed in this tube the small intestine. What happens next is that the small intestine joins the large intestine.
So 5 times 9, that is 45. So we have 45 minus-- what's 5 times 4? Well, that's 20.
That is negative 8. Let's see if that is greater than negative 3 plus 1 is negative 2 times 3 is negative 6.
Find the measurement of angle CAD, so angle CAD.. this angle right over here.. measure of that angle, let's just call it x, so that I don't have to keep writing the measure of angle CAD and the other thing that might jump out at you is that the measures of the other angles' measures are given here.. 50 degrees, 45 degrees and 37 degrees. The other thing that might jump out at you if you take the outer edge of all these angles which are adjacent to each other if you take the outer edge, it forms a straight angle. So this entire angle is going to be 180 degrees.
(Music) Kiran Bir Sethi: And the city will give free time.
It's measuring, for example, if you wanted to put a fence around your carpet -- I'm kind of mixing the indoor and outdoor analogies -- it would be how much fencing you would need. So it would be the distance around. So it would be that distance plus that distance plus that distance plus that distance.
We say how many times does 7 go into 9? Well, it goes into it exactly one time, but when you take 7 into 9 one time, what do you have left over? Well, you're going to have 2 left over, right?
Well, 8 times 10 is 80, and the greatest common factor of 8 and 10?
So it's looking at you with 2 of its front eyes. 2 of its 8 eyes. So the 2 front eyes represent what fraction of the eyes?
In that saliva are a couple of different enzymes and I'm going to color code the enzymes as well. The first enzyme that's in the saliva is called amylase. Amylase works to begin the digestion of carbohydrates that's why I've done it in purple, we call that salivary amylase because there's also another kind of amylase that comes into play later on in the digestive tract.
4/9 v. 3/4 v. 4/5, 11/12, 13/15. You can try to estimate them, but you'll be able to directly compare them if they all have the same denominator. So, the trick here is to first find the common denominator.
The function f(x) is defined as f(x) = 49 - (x ^2). Find the value of f(5). So whenever you're dealing with a function, you take your input -- in this case, our input is going to be our 5.
Let's write 0.8 as a fraction. So 0.8... the 8 right over here is in the tenths place.
This June we learned that out private lives are no longer private. The US government is secretly tracking the emails purchases, text messages, location and phone calls of people all over the world. Ed Rooney, Ed?
A few times a year they tell their engineers, "Go for the next 24 hours and work on anything you want, as long as it's not part of your regular job. Work on anything you want."
Twenty-eight years ago, this is what the polar ice cap -- the North Polar ice cap -- looked like at the end of the summer, at the fall equinox. This last fall, I went to the Snow and Ice Data Center in Boulder, Colorado, and talked to the researchers here in Monterey at the Naval Postgraduate Laboratory. This is what's happened in the last 28 years.
Mortality at birth was over two-and-a-half percent. Over 15 percent of the deaths among adults and children occurred because of intestinal parasites and diarrhea from dirty water and inadequate sanitation -- all entirely preventable and treatable. Over 13 percent of the deaths were from respiratory illnesses -- again, all preventable and treatable.
Let's do some exponent examples that involve division.
if we were making measurements here then we would observe the same but lots of these that is the same experimental results that we did before and so would you because you are observing this experiment through with the camera which is fast into this car added you were in the moving frame of reference but now we're going to do the experiment again and this time you watched through a camera which is fixed in the poor frame of reference or concentrate on watching the clock to lecture i follow us i think you'll see that in a move faster that way and not so bad this way relative to u_n_ relative to the wall husband
Now, 15% mathematically, you can deal directly with percentages, but it's much easier if it's written as a decimal.
And I realize that when I started this problem, I asked you I think I was asking, how far along the platform We figured out its total horizontal displacement
Even as the explosion happened, I was escaping.
So in other words, this number is the average of my first five exams. We just figured out the average of the first four exams. But now, we sum up the first four exams here.
My mom took me to my grandmother's home and told her to take care of me. They treated me like a maid. So then I decided to run away from my home at the age of eleven,
0 times 3 is 0. Nothing left over. So it goes into it forty times.
20 times 5 is 100... 20 times 50 is 1000 square meters. So it's pretty clear when you calculate the area that Apple Lane, you are getting more square meters than you would get at Fibonacci Drive.
So 28 times 6-- 8 times 6 is 48. 2 times 6 is 12, plus 4 is 16. So right, 168.
Negative seven should also work.
We are already at negative 3, it will become 25 more negative than that. So you can view this as... we are moving 25 more in the negative direction. Or you can view this as 3 plus 25 is 28, we're doing it in the negative direction, so it's negative 28.
a plus b times open parentheses c plus d is equal to a plus bc plus bd represents which of the following properties? So to get from the left-hand side to the right-hand side, it looks like what they did is they multiplied the b times the c plus d. In fact, they distributed the b. b times c plus d is b times c, plus b times d.
So divide the 10 by 5 and you divide the 15 by 5, and you get-- 10 divided by 5 is 2 and 15 divided by 5 is 3. You get 2/3. Now, to understand why this works, let's draw it out.
Well, 2 times 2, times 2 is equal to 8. And there's no really easy way, especially once you go to the fourth root, or the fifth root, and you have decimals of calculating these. You probably need a calculator most of the time to do these.
(Laughter) Wait -- The same study found that smiling is as stimulating as receiving up to 16,000 pounds sterling in cash.
Well for 54 I can attend a slight longer amount of session under the trial plan.
And so our left hand side is just going to be 5z plus 7, minus 7, those cancel out 5z is less than 27 minus 20, sorry, 27 minus 7, which is 20 so we have 5z less than 20. Now we can divide both sides of this inequality by 5 and we don't have to swap the inequality because we're dividing by a positive number and so we get z is less than 20 over 5. Z is less than 4.
Think about four, you just have to think about the last 2 digits, To see are the last 2 digits divisible by four. Immediately, you could look at this one over here, see it's an odd number, if it's not divisible by 2, it's definitely not going to be divisible by four.
Solve for y and check your solution.
like 291 divided into-- let me just throw some digits over here- actually let's stole another digit right over here- So this is- how many times does 291 go into- what is this- 9,873,952 And to just kind of get our bearings we know what 291 times 1 is.
So it seems we can get pretty close if we do 291 times 6 If we do a 1746, and then add two zeros to it This is going to be times 6 with two zeros
"who do you think you are?" The thing to understand about shame is, it's not guilt. Shame is a focus on self, guilt is a focus on behavior.
Another way you could have thought about it is that you could just look at the absolute value of each number so you say one times one is one they have different signs so it's going to be negative which have gotten you the same answer either way So now with the scenario that x is equal to 0
So 4 times 2f plus 4g is indeed the same thing as 8f plus 4g, which is, we already know, is the same thing as our original expression. And you can distribute this to verify that. So this is also a valid expression.
Let's do the same thing for 6/9.
We know that negative 12 needs to be less than 2 minus 5x. That has to be satisfied, and-- let me do it in another color-- this inequality also needs to be satisfied.
(Laughter) But at the same time they had a perspicacious knowledge of the forest that was astonishing. Their hunters could smell animal urine at 40 paces and tell you what species left it behind.
Identify all the rays shown in the image below. and this is a reminder what a ray is. A ray start at some point and then goes on forever in some direction.
It's going to equal that number one times anything is going to be that anything right overthere.
Negative 4 times 8 is negative 32, plus 8 is negative 24. So that satisfies so that when x is 8, y does equal negative 24. And then finally, let's look at that last point.
And then you have the 1 tenth. So 20 tenths plus 1 tenth is 21 tenths.
So we had to multiply 16 times 3 to get to 48, so we're going to have to multiply this 5 times 3.
So that is the 3/4 part and that is your one whole. Hopefully that makes sense and hopefully you understand why it connects. Because you say, well, how many wholes do you have?
If x is any larger number than the number I'm solving for, then the sale price is going to be more than $fifty and I won't be able to afford it. So that's how we set the-- the highest I can pay is $fifty and that's the sale price. So going back to how we did these problems before.
So, 11/12 = 165/180. And then finally, we have 13/15.
Well, many thousands of years ago, people took their tape measures out and they keep measuring circumferences and radiuses. And let's say when their tape measures weren't so good, let's say they measured the circumference of the circle and they would get well, it looks like it's about 3.
What number can we add to 1,893 to get to 0? So we're going to have to essentially take 1,893 away. So the only number that we can add that would take away 1,893 is negative 1,893.
less than or equal to x. So we can also write it like this. X needs to be greater than or equal to negative 1.
So one way to look at it is just this 2 in 0.25 is in the tenths place, so it literally represents 2 tenths.
Now, if we wanted to write this as a mixed number, if we want to write this as a mixed number, 3 goes into 5 one time with remainder 2. So it's going to be 1 2/3. So it's going to be 1 2/3.
So let's think about what we have on the left side: we have 3 masses with mass X, so you can say we have 3x and then we have 2 masses of 1 kilogram, so in total we have 2 kg. So + 2. So one way to think about the total mass on the left-hand side is 3x + 2.
No, it doesn't.
It is 6, and we are done. You can't reduce this any more. 6 and 77 aren't divisible by-- don't have any common factors.
We're told to graph all possible values for h on the number line. And this is a especially interesting inequality because we also have an absolute value here. So the way we're going to do it, we're going to solve this inequality in terms of the absolute value of h, and from there we can solve it for h.
So it's important to make sure, at least for the sake of this exercise, that the system, that the computer program knows which angle you're going to talk about. Let's do one more of these. 155 degree angle.
So just like that. And then they give us a protractor to actually measure the angle. So let's set it up.
So 4 marbles plus the 5 marbles. So that's what happened after the first sentence. He found 4 marbles to add to his 5 marbles currently in his pocket.
So 225 divided by 3 is 75. So the smallest, the smallest of the odd integers is 75. So this one is 75.
We're starting off at 7. We're 7 to the right of zero. And to that we're adding a -7.
So 8 goes into 70 eight times. So it goes into 70 eight times.
This solution right here-- x is equal to negative 1 --we could plot on the number line right over there. And then the other solution-- x is equal to negative 5 --we can plot it right over there. Hopefully you found that enjoyable.
Well, 4 times 84, we already said, is 336.
So based on what we just saw, let's take the length, 4 meters, and multiply by the width, and multiply by 2 meters. Now, 4 times 2 is 8. So this should give us 8 square meters.
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve, thirteen, fourteen, fifteen, sixteen, seventeen, eighteen, nineteen, twenty. And even if I were to throw some commas in here, it's not going to really help the situation to make it more readable. Let me throw some commas in here.
1,543 plus 0. Well, we're adding nothing to it, so it's just going to be 1,543.
25 doesn't go into 1 25 doesn't go into 11.
And that was the language that we really couldn't read - - until we had the Rosetta Stone. And we could see within the writing of the Rosetta Stone, cartouches, which held the names of the rulers.
12 times 5, which is equal to 60/1, which is the exact same thing as 60. So you can actually make 60 children's or babies' T-shirts from 48 yards if each of them use 4/5 of a yard.
Remember, if you removed a Y from only 1 side, that would unbalance the scale. The scale was already balanced whatever you have to do to the one side after you do the other. So I'm gonna remove a Y, I'm gonna remove Y mass from both sides.
So lets put a 6 there 6 times 1 is 6 6 times 2 is 120.
So 2/3 is going to be right around here, right? That is 2/3. x could be less than 2/3. And this is interesting.
It is 10.1 times 12.07 feet, it gives a 121.907. So this equal to - let's scroll over a little bit to the right - this is equal to - a little bit more over the right - this is equal to 121.907 feet squared, or squared feet. Now, we are not done with our calculation, but there might be a temptation right here, say look, I have 4 significant figures here,
Visualization is right at the heart of my own work too. I teach global health. And I know, having the data is not enough.
If x is equal to - Let's say that x is equal to 1, and y is equal to 8, then this expression would evaluate to - (Well every time we see an x, we want to put a 1 there.)
0 shows up four times. That is that information right there.
So if I can convert the starting block into eighths, and the way that I could make this into 1/8 is by essentially dividing it by 11. Now I have 11/8 and I divide by 11, I'm only going to have 1/8. So let me cut into 11 pieces.
What is this story of you giving electricity to the utility. It is by using solar PV on the roof. Many people think the traditional way of getting electricity from solar Panels and storing them in Batteries and use this stored energy in the night when the sun is not there.
Let's do one more of these. So we get 9x minus 9y is equal to 4. Just for fun, let's just start off by dividing both sides of the equation by 9.
As you know, it's not going to turn out well.
If 1/3 times 3 is equal to 1, then that means that 1 divided by 3 must be equal to 1/3. And this comes straight out of how we first even thought about fractions. The first way that we ever thought about fractions was, well, let's start with a whole.
1/2, if our denominator is 300, we multiplied the denominator by 150 to go from 200 to 300, so we have to multiply the numerator by 150.
What if I had two to the eighth plus two to the eighth? This is a bit of a trick question. Well I just said if we're adding, we can't really do anything.
(Laughter) They only make good former spouses.
In y years.
But the world has changed, and it's overdue to upgrade that mindset and that taxonomy of the world, and to understand it. And that's what I'm going to show you, because since 1960 what has happened in the world up to 2010 is that a staggering four billion people have been added to the world population. Just look how many.
9 goes into 80-- well, we know that 9 times 9 is 81, so it has to go into it only eight times because it can't go into it nine times.
So, it's 1 second for every 12 feet Notice, all I did was take this information right over here, 12 feet/s and I wrote it as second per foot, 12 feet for every 1 second, 1 second for every 12 feet What's useful about this is, this will now give me the time it takes for the squirrel in seconds
So 3 divided by 3 is just 1. And then 10 to the ninth divided by 10 to the fourth, well that's going to be 10 to the 9 minus 4, 10 to the fifth. So it's going to be 1 times 10 to the fifth, which, once again, is 1 followed by five zeros, or the exact same thing as 100,000.
108 is, we could say, 4 times what?
Six-ninths minus two-fifths. Well we're gonna have to find a common denominator. So this is going to be the same thing and I think the least common multiple of nine and five is going to be forty-five.
3t plus 4g is equal to 6. And we have negative 6t plus g is also equal to 6.
This clearly is greater than 1 and less than 10, and to get from 1.5 to 15, we have to multiply, you have to multiply by 10, one way to think about it is 15 is 15.0, so you have a decimal here, Where, if we're gonna move the decimal one to the left to get us 1.5, we're essentially dividing by 5, then we also sorry, if we're moving the decimal one to the left, to make it 1.5, that's essentially dividing by 10.
So my change in x is equal to negative 6. And you can even see I started it at x is equal to 3, and I went all the way to x is equal to negative 3. That's a change of negative 6.
Let me do it in orange... as 5 minus 2, that's the whole number parts, and then you have plus 5/8 minus 1/5.
5 times 8 is 40. And we have nothing. We have nothing left over.
3/9 is the same thing as 1/3, so x needs to be less than 2/3. So or x is less than 2/3. So that's our solution set. x needs to be greater than or equal to 2, or less than 2/3.
So 12 goes into 21, well it goes into it one time.
So we could rewrite this compound inequality as negative 5 has to be less than or equal to x minus 4, and x minus 4 needs to be less than or equal to 13. And then we could solve each of these separately, and then we have to remember this "and" there to think about the solution set because it has to be things that satisfy this equation and this equation. So let's solve each of them individually.
9 times.
And then, plus 77 minus 64 plus 77 is 13. So the left-hand side becomes 13 over 3.
(Laughter) Now, luckily for me, I live and work in New York City, where there are plenty of dinosaurs.
This would be 1/5 times 3-- I'm going to keep the colors the same-- plus 1/5 times 1/3. And this is going to be equal to-- well, we could rewrite 1/5 times 3 as 1/5 times 3/1. That's what 3 really is if we wrote it as a fraction.
We now hopefully know a little about variables and as we covered in the last video, a variable can be really any symbol, although we typically use letters because we're used to writing and typing letters. But it can be anything from an x, to a y, a z, an a, a b, and oftentimes we start using greek letters like theta. But you can really use any symbol to say
Subtract again we get a 4
12 times 5 is 60.
And we know that the length of the segment JK is 7x plus 9.
So, we've gone 2 to the left to get to 0. We have to move how many more to the left? We've already moved 2 to the left, to get to 8, we have to move 6 more to the left.
Now, that was the language of the administration. That was the language of government. And the reason for that is because
This original thing 7 's if void and 14 divided by 7 is 2 Then your solution is x equals 2 But just to make this very tangible in your head, what is happening here is that when we divide both sides of the the equation by 7, we literally we divide both sides by 7
And we're done. And obviously you might have gotten an answer in some other order, but the order in which I write these terms don't matter. It just matters that you were able to simplify it to these four terms.
9 minus 0 is 9. We have to regroup from the thousands place, so let's take 1,000 from there. Let's give that 1,000 to the hundreds place, so it becomes 10 hundreds.
Let's do some more of these classic age word problems. So we're told that William is 4 times as old as Ben.
Plus three is forty-five. So the remainder is fifty. I see a pattern.
We multiply the 10 times 5, so we have to multiply the 7 times 5. So it's going to be 35 over 50. Now that our denominators are the same, we have it over 50.
Now let's just assume that this is some kind of special yoga studio, where you can even attend a half session and they will just charge you half the cost, 6 dollars. If you attend a 1/4 of a session they charge you 3 dollars. so they keep track of exactly what fraction of a session that you attend. You don't have to attend a whole number of sessions.
The 1/2 is smaller than the 7/12, so it might be easier to just do this as mixed numbers so we don't have to do all of that borrowing and regrouping. So let's write both of them as mixed numbers. So we have 1 and 1/2.
Viruses. And in my opinion, viruses are, on some level, the most fascinating thing in all of biology. Because they really blur the boundary between what is an inanimate object and what is life?
If you took 1 away, then of course, he'd only have 4 left.
What I want to do in this video is order these fractions from least to greatest And, the easiest way--and the way that people are sure to get the right answer-- is to find a common denominator, because if we can't find a common denominator, these fractions are difficult to compare:
identify the mose reasonable units to measure the weight of each of the choices below so we have an: Average Adult a slice of bread a kitchen table pack of gum so I am an an average adult and I know that I weigh about 160lbs, so I know that pounds are pretty good measurement for about something the weight of an adult so adults in that catagory right over there.
If I put 1 there, I'd only have 1,000. 6,000 is definitely going to be bigger than any of the numbers that could be constructed with the 2, 0, or 1 in the thousands place. Now the exact same logic, we want the next largest number in the hundreds place.
So this is blood coming from the heart and then this is going to go back to the heart. Well, the heart's on both sides. So let me write it this way.
2x squared minus 3x squared, plus 5x minus 4. And they tell us that x is equal to negative 1. One thing we could do is simplify this before we even substitute for negative 1.
So, copy and paste So, she's going to have 8 of these
8 times 5 is 40. Subtract.
10 plus 5 is 15, plus 5 is 20, plus 5 is 25, plus 5 is 30, plus 5 is 35. So all of these evaluate to 35, just so you see that they're the same thing. These are all equivalent to 35.
So 13 20ths ... or 13 over 20 (13/20) ... could also be viewed as 13 ÷ 20, or 13/20.
Choose all the relationships that are described by the following equation-- y is equal to 7/8 x. All right, let's look at these relationships.
35 times 35: 5 times 5 is 25. Carry the 2.
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to draw a number line. Let me draw a number line here, and I'm just going to mark off the hundreds on the number line. So maybe we have 24,100, and then we go to 24,200, then we go to 24,300, and then we go to 24,400.
So let's just think this through: "x times y." Well I could write that - I could either write that as x × y, or I could just write that as xy.
20% means you're really going to meet That means if you want to shade 20%, if you break up the square into 100 pieces, we want to shade 20 of them.
Well, luckily, they were timing the whole thing, and they've not, and they've also showed that it's a, it's a world record. But this right over here is in seconds, is how long it took Usain Bolt to run the 100 meters.
We can look at the right, we can have ray FE, start at F go through E and beyond E, you can have ray FC, start at F go through C and beyond C that is teh same thing as FE ray FE and ray FC are the same as the point E is on ray FC, then finally we have not focussed on point A you may think there is ray AE, but the line does not go beyond E, so it is not a ray, to the top of A there is no other point, so there is no ray there either that is all the rays based on the points specified.
In the following polynomial, identify the terms along with the coefficient and exponent of each term. So the terms are the things being added up in this polynomial.
And this one over here, you don't even have to add them up, because we already know it's not divisible by 3, if it's not divisible by 3, it can't be divisible by 9 but if you did add up the digits, you'd get 19 which is not divisible by 9. So this also is not divisible by 9. And finally, divisibility by 10.
It would be 6.4 times 10 to the what? one, two, three, four, five, six. I have to include the six. So times ten to the minus six.
There's 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 equal sections. There are 5 equal sections. And what fraction of them are pink?
So, integers - the best way to think of them they're really the counting numbers, or the natural numbers, plus zero, and the opposite of the counting numbers. So the counting numbers are like 1,2,3,4, ...so on and so forth.
That's, I guess, the Western term for it. And the reason why they're called magnets is because they're named after lodestones that were found near the Greek province of Magnesia.
We're asked to graph y is equal to 2.5 times x.
12 + 8 is 20, 12 + 8 is 20, so this is all going to add up to 40 inches. And we're done. I guess this is a very small field, this is only 8 inches.
I don't know ... y + z. Now everything is a variable.
C is equal to 5/9 times F minus 32. And we want to solve for F. So the first useful thing to do might be to get rid of this 5/9 from both sides, or at least from the right side of the equation, so we just have an F minus 32.
Well, that is going to be negative 6, that's our end point, minus 3. That gives us that distance, which is negative 9. For every time we go back 9, we're going to go down 3.
Click "Save changes" and you're done! If you go to SETTlNGS and click the DESlGN tab you can also change or upload a background image. Just select the file you would like use and save your changes.
Seven times seven is forty-nine. Plus four, which is fifty-three.
Graph x is less than 4. So, let's draw ourselves a numberline overhere. So let me draw a number line.
So the left center equals greater than or equal to and so these guys cancel out negative 3 divided by negative 3 equals 1, so we have z is greater than or equal to 18 over negative 3 is negative 6 and remember, it's this constraint OR this constraint and this constraint right over here boils down to this and this one boils down to this so our solution set z is less than 4 OR z is greater than or equal to negative -6. So let me make this clear. Let me rewrite it.
And we now know they can get even smaller than 0.
I have constructed a 10 degree angle. And you want to be careful here when you use this tool because the angle in question-- let me move the protractor show you what I'm talking about-- that this right over here is the angle that we're talking about.
The left-hand side of this equation just becomes a w-- these cancel out-- is less than or equal to 150 plus 2.5 is 152.5, and then we still have our and. And on this side of the equation-- this cancels out-- we just have a w is greater than or equal to negative 2.5 plus 150, that is 147.5. So the width of our leg has to be greater than 147.5 millimeters and less than 152.5 millimeters.
So I'm pushing on this block with a force of F for a distance of d. And what I want to figure out is-- well, we know what the work is.
But let's start at 0, and 0 means nothing. If I have 0 lemons, it means I have no lemons. So:
We're subtracting an 8 from a 9. That seems pretty straightforward. That's just going to be a 1- a 1 in the 1's place.
Our knowledge of the exact relationships between these ancestors is incomplete and often is revised because of new fossil finds. Some of them were our direct ancestors. Some of them were distant cousins, who became evolutionary dead-ends.
So if y = 3, and z =2, then you're going to have - the left hand expression is going to be x + 3 + 2 - which is going to be x + 5 -
How long will it take the squirrel to run 9 feet? Round to the nearest 100th of a second. Fair enough.
So the inverse of-- so they give us z to the third over-- so it's negative z to the third over 2xy to the third.
And it was this common language used by the Egyptians. And the top, of course, was the sacred writing.
And to show this on the number line, we do a circle around 40 to show that we're not including 40.
Now, how many groups of eleven students there are? So there are fifty-five students.
Which are ironically. Not necessarily used in UK, they tend to be used in America. So lets convert this into miles per hour and the one thing I will tell you just in case you don't know is that their 1.61 kilometers is equal to 1 is equal to 1 mile.
It's a huge trademark violation, but it's pretty clever. (Laughter) That one day of intense autonomy has produced a whole array of software fixes that might never have existed.
This is Steve and this is Steve's uncle and Steve is in a bit of a bind. Not only does he not have any money but he also owes Michael, who is not depicted here. He owes Michael $3.
(Laughter) It doesn't. If we had time, I could go into this, but we don't.
So plus 1/8, well, that's going to be this one right over here, so that's my 1/8.
18+7 -- you're probably saying, Sal, where are you getting the 18 from, but take my word for it. 18+7=25.
And so they'll just start growing. And then let's say one of them experiences a little defect, and he says, you know what, gee, something's a little bit wrong with me. I, the cell, recognize this in myself, and the cells will actually kill themselves.
And so the thousands place is the 3 right here, and so if we were round it up to the nearest thousand, we would go to 420-- let me write it so we just focus on the 3-- we would go up to 424,000 if we wanted to round up, 424,000, and if we wanted to round down, we would go to 423,000.
Let's say, seventeen over eight. What does that equal as a mixed number? You can actually do this in your head, but I'll write it out just so you don't get confused.
We have a 2 there. This is the next smallest.
Then I have 23 chromosomes from my mother. And not to be stereotypical, but maybe I'll do that in a more feminine color. Let's see, so I have 23 chromosomes from my mother.
[Ben] There it is. Two is a factor.
If I go from negative 3 to 0, I went up by 3. So my change in x is 3. So let me write this, change in x, delta x is equal to 3.
It goes into 12 one time.
You have to add a bunch of 0's to the left of the 3 You have to keep moving the decimal over to the left To do that, we're essentially making the number much, much, much smaller
And we can kind of view this, 7.25, as one way to represent these four numbers without having to list these four numbers. There are other representations you'll learn later on. Like the mode.
"So where is the hope?" Several years ago, a few friends of mine decided we needed to bridge the disconnect between our generation and the generation of young women. It's not enough to say you have two Nobel laureates from the Republic of Liberia when your girls' kids are totally out there and no hope, or seemingly no hope.
So Line ST- you put the arrows on each end of that top bar to say that this a line and not just a line segment.
And either way, you can conceptualize right over here, you are going to get negative six negative six is the answer. Now, so you are already starting to feel better about this part right over here negative times a positive, or a positive times a negative is going to give you a negative. Now lets take to the really un-intuitive one and measure negative times a negative, and all of a sudden negatives kind of cancel to give you a positive.
Well six times eighteen.
Negative 16 divided by positive 8, that equals negative 2. Remember, different signs will get you a negative result.
This 1 is kind of useless. So 5 is just 5. And then 15, let's do 15.
I'll say a million dollars just because we're used to that.
I don't know, let's say R is over there.
So let me color that in. So we have 1/2.
We know from experimentation when we were all kids, this is the north pole, this is the south pole. That the north pole is going to be attracted to the south pole of another magnet.
And so 9 plus 0 is 9, 6 plus 2 is 8, 4 plus 0 is 4, and then we have a 4 right over here. And we have two total numbers behind the decimal point, one, two. So this gives us 44.89.
A common house spider has 8 eyes. If a spider is looking at you with its 2 front eyes and 3 of its other eyes, what fraction of its eyes are looking at you? And just to show that we're not making this stuff up, these are actual pictures of spiders and you see in each of these pictures that they have 8 eyes.
16 goes into 40 two times.
"You've been around for 36 months, and this is it?"
And I will get 1.3 minus 0.7 x's, or apples, or whatever you want to call them. So is equal to 12. You could imagine that I did the reverse distributive property out here.
Because about five of my friends were like, "Wooo, I wouldn't want to be your therapist."
Well, 7 times 7 is 49, so it's going to go seven times. 7 times 7, 49. Subtract, you get 1.
So we get, negative sixteen minus five is negative twenty-one, is less than or equal to 3x plus five minus five is 3x, which is less than or equal to twenty minus five which is fifteen.
Plus three is equal to-- you do the multiplication first. You can even think of it as order of operations, but you just should know that you do the multiplication first. So four times two is eight.
2 minus 1 is just 1. 3 minus 5.
"You may fool the whole world down the pathway of life and get pats on your back as you pass but your final reward will be heartache and tears if you have cheated the man in the glass." Thank You.
CA: Based on the people we've seen at TED, I would say you're truly one of the two or three best inventors in the world right now.
I don't think anybody here will dare not to let-go.
2/3 is in lowest possible terms, or simplified form, however you want to think about it. Now, let's try to do 54/81. Now, let's see.
This is .69 of the way between 36 and 49. So lets go roughly .69 of the way between 6 and 7. So this is once again, just a approximate, it's not necessarily give us the exact answer, we have to use that as to make a good initial guess and see how well it works.
3 and 1/2 plus 11 and 2/5 plus 4 and 3/15. So we've already seen that we could view this as 3 plus 1/12 plus 11 plus 2/5-- let me write that down. This is the same thing as 3 plus 1/12 plus 11 plus 2/5 plus 4 plus 3/15.
2 goes into 0 zero times.
If you were to multiply by 10, we would be moving the decimal over to the right. And there are other videos that go into far more depth on the intuition behind that. But anyway, we're dividing 113.9 by 100.
So we added four more blocks. We have nine blocks now. We have nine blocks, so it looks like each time we're adding four blocks.
4 goes into 5 one time. Let me switch up the colors.
This is another problem that Kortaggio sent me, and I like these problems a lot because they seem fairly simple on the surface, and actually the solutions are pretty simple. But just the nature of the lack of information they give, it becomes kind of hard to even get started with these problems. And I'll be frank, this problem, I kind of stumbled around with it for a couple of minutes until I finally realized what they were asking for or how to solve for it.
It's equal to 28. So this side right here is going to be equal to 28, by the Pythagorean theorem. Let's do one more of these.
so all I did is I rewrote this and essentially expanded out, I broke up the mixed numbers in to their whole number parts and their fractional parts and then what I like to do is I like to add the whole number parts so this two plus this seven, so I'll do the two plus seven over here... I'll add those up, and to that I will add the fractional parts so to that, I will add the five thirteenths to the six thirteenths so if we add the whole number parts two plus seven is nine and the fractional parts, already having the same denominator five thirteenths plus six thirteenths your going to get eleven thirteenths, five plus six is eleven so you get nine plus eleven thirteenths well that's just the same thing as nine and eleven thirteenths and we are done!
And what you see emerging from the surface, essentially budding from the surface of this white blood cell-- and this gives you a sense of scale too-- these are HlV-1 viruses. And so you're familiar with the terminology, the HlV is a virus that infects white blood cells. AlDS is the syndrome you get once your immune system is weakened to the point.
Which equals four thirds So two minus two thirds is four thirds So this is equal to five y plus four thirds
So the area of this figure right over here is 35.
Hi, I'm Asa Dotzler from Mozilla, and I'm here to show you how simple it is to switch to Firefox. Just go to getfirefox.com with your current web browser and click the green download button on the website to save the firefox setup file to your desktop. Close the browser window and double-click the firefox setup icon to start the install
And then the 1 is in the ten-thousands place. And you see, every time you move to the left, you move one place to the left, you're multiplying by 10. Ones place, tens place, hundreds place, thousands place, ten-thousands place.
And 8 goes into 40? Well, it goes into 40 exactly five times.
We've cut it up into sections of 8, so it literally is 8/8. So let me just do it like this. So the 2 is this whole region right over here, that's 1.
9 minus 7 is 2. And once again, 2 is just 2 units away from 0. So it's just 2.
2 goes into 1 no times.
But anything that's even is going to be divisible by 1, itself, and 2.
I've got pairs of mixed numbers and improper fractions, and I want to think about which of the two is larger. So 1 and 7/8, 39/10.
So going down by 1/3 is the same thing as multiplying the quantity by 2/3. So if we multiply each of these quantities by 2/3, we can still hold this inequality, because we're doing the same thing to both sides of this inequality, and we're multiplying by a positive number. If we were multiplying by a negative number, we would have to swap the inequality.
So 0.52 times 10 to the number of terms we have.
PROBLEM: "Express the rational number 19/27 (or 19 27ths) as a terminating decimal or a decimal that eventually repeats. Include only the first six digits of the decimal in your answer."
So we see that 1/2 will equal 2/4, and that equals 4/8. Now do you see a pattern here if we just look at the numerical relationships between 1/2, 2/4, and 4/8?
So eight (8) divided by negative two (-2) is negative four (-4). Now negative sixteen (-16) divided by positive four (4)-- now be very careful here. If I just said positive sixteen (16) divided by positive four (4), that would just be four (4).
Let's multiply 4 times 2012. Actually, let's make it a little bit simpler, let's multiply 4 times 201. Just to simplify things a little bit.
So 584 thousand. So it's 584 times 1,000. And what's that going to look like?
4 is going to be a factor.
25 plus 2y plus 5y is equal to 350. Use the distributive property.
So 1 times 1 zero times is just going to be 1. And that was a little bit clearer when we did it like this, where we said 2 to the,
So 8 to the 2/3 is the same thing is 8 squared, and then the third root of that. But you could view it the other way. This should also be equal to 8 to the 1/3 power squared.
At 62, I decided to step down from the corporate world and focus on the social sector. My late son used to constantly nag me that our time and wealth should be used towards worthy causes. I am very lucky I have come across two outstanding NGO's-
And this is his average speed, or his average rate, over the hundred meters. But to think about this in terms of kilometers per, kilometers per hour. So try to figure out if you can, if you can rewrite this in kilometers per hour.
And indeed, '84 = 7 x 12' And it all worked out.
7 times 10 to the minus 6th. So now you can imagine. You know, numbers like, imagine the number, what if we had a 7,
What I want to do in this video is give you at least a basic overview of 'probability' - a word that you've probably heard a lot. And you are probably a little bit familiar with it. But, hopefully, this will give you a little deeper understanding.
So here, they're asking us 3 times 10 to the ninth is 30,000 times larger than what number? So once again, we can divide. So we have 3 times 10 to the ninth is 30,000 times larger than what number?
To get from 9 to 45, we have to multiply times 5. So to get our numerator over here, we have to multiply it times 5. So 2 times 5 is 10.
1, 2, 3, and that gets us to negative 1. This is equal to negative 1. Now let's mix it up a little bit more.
216 is 2 times 108.
150 is 1/4 of 600. Now let's answer their actual question. Identify the percent.
I'm going to withhold her ability to get more money from me, until she pays it back. (Laughter) True story, by the way.
So they're saying 150 is 25% of what number? Or another way to view this, 150 is 25% of some number. So let's let x, x is equal to the number that 150 is 25% of, right?
Thank you. Two years ago, I stood on the TED stage in Arusha, Tanzania. I spoke very briefly about one of my proudest creations.
And on the left-hand side-- I'll have to get my calculator out for this one-- I have 7.65 divided by 0.75, which is equal to 10.2. m is 10.2, so Jade can travel 10.2 miles.
Well, same thing again. seventy-five goes into five hundred six times. six times seventy-five is going to be four hundred and fifty again.
Let's add 10x to both sides.
(Laughter) (Applause)
Twelve divided by four. So I want to divide these twelve objects-- maybe they're apples or plums. And divide them into groups of four.
Divide by 4, you get 8.
I was all set to be a diplomat, teacher, doctor -- all laid out. Then, I don't look it, but I was the Indian national squash champion for three years.
(Laughter) And one man would tell the stories of his father by using a platform called Twitter to communicate the excrement his father would gesticulate. And after all this, everyone paused; they took a step back.
I really didn't know her at all. She came in totally defeated, and she said,
So for example, angle CAB, angle CAB, corresponds to this angle over here which we can call FDE. If we say angle ABC
We have this negative 5 squared, or actually I should say we have some subtracting of 5 squared.
If you divide by 10 twice, you're essentially dividing by 100. So you move the decimal to the left twice, and you get 0. 592.
So it becomes 24,200.
(Laughter) All the cameras were, of course, on Sophia. That was fortunate for me, because in most press photos
If you add zero to it, you then get the whole numbers and then to that you want to add the negative counting numbers or the opposite of the natural numbers, so the opposite of 1 is -1, the opposite of 2 is -2 the opposite of 3 is -3 ... so on and so forth.
1 plus 2 plus 0, well, that's equal to 1 plus 2 is 3 plus 0 is 3, and 3 is definitely divisible by 3. So 120 is going to be divisible by 3. To figure what that number that you have to multiply by 3 is, you could do it in your head.
3 times 5 is 15. Subtract, you get 2, and then you bring down a 1.
2x is equal to negative 11 plus 5, that's negative 6. And we can divide both sides by 2 and we get x is equal to negative 3. So we've got two solutions, depending on whether this thing in here is equal to 11 or negative 11.
We're asked to add 4/9 and 11/12 and to write our answer as a mixed number, and then simplify and write our answer as a mixed number. So here we have two fractions we're adding together, but we have different denominators. So whenever you add fractions, the first thing you have to do is check the denominators.
So one / three of $eighteen is $six. So, just to give a quick review what we did. We said the sale price on six guavas, $12.60.
1 times 9 is 9.
So you're going to have, the 2's are going to cancel out, the 5's are going to cancel out your just going to have a 3 leftover, so it's clearly divisible by 20 and if you were to divide it by 12, you'd divide it by 2 times 2 times 3 this is the same thing as 12 and so these guys would cancel out, and you would just have a 5 leftover so it's clearly divisible by both, and this number right here is 60 it's 4 times 3, which is 12, times 5.
1 plus 9 is 10. Put a comma here, just so it's easy to read, every third digit. So 23 times 44 is 1,012.
We can start at 2 here and it would be greater than or equal to 2, so include everything greater than or equal to 2.
So 291 times 3 would be 873 We want to have a bunch of zeros after the 873
So we started a nonprofit venture which, linking data to design, we called Gapminder, from the London Underground, where they warn you, "mind the gap." So we thought Gapminder was appropriate. And we started to write software which could link the data like this.
Man 10: It's beautiful.
What is (x + y) equal to? Well, they tell us right over here, x + y is equal to 7 So this whole thing simplifies to
This negative 1, this negative 1. Well, we could add 2 to both sides of this equation. Think about what happens there.
It's 13, so it's a total 13 gap between the, 6 squared and 7 squared and this is, this is 9 of the way through it. So just as a kind of an approximation, maybe and it's not going to work out perfectly because we're squaring it, this isn't a linear relationship, but it's going to be closer to, 7 than it's going to be to 6 and it, at least the square or the.
All of these y values, they're all negative.
And they also ask us to figure out what the equation of this line actually is. So let me get my scratch pad out and we could think about it.
Eight hundred twenty-eight? Is that what we got?
One final point: I'm optimistic, because I believe we have the capacity, at moments of great challenge, to set aside the causes of distraction and rise to the challenge that history is presenting to us.
10 minus 5 is 5.
1 plus 3 plus 9 is equal to 13. Now we have to remind ourselves that this is thirteen 10s. Or another way of thinking about it, this is three 10s and one hundred.
So 17 minus 9 is 8.
Well, 7's prime, it only has two factors: 1 and itself So what is the greatest common factor?
So that are those three terms and then I have plus two plus nine plus four and plus three. This is just the sum of our digits. This is what we did up here.
And we can factor 9 down more into 3 times 3 to realize it's a perfect square, but we could leave it like that. So this first term right here we can write as the square root of 2 times 2 times the square root of 5 times the square root of 9. I'm going to put the square root of 9 out front.
When you divide 6 into 23, you get a remainder of 5. You could view it as, I divided it into the remainder and everything else. And the reason why this is interesting is because we know that this is going to be equal to 18 over 6 plus 5 over 6.
I am starting off where the -15 started or where the -15 left off. and then I am putting that arrow after that. And we don't know yet what number this gets us to. We are going to have to do a little math here.
So if you add just the whole number parts, 1 plus 2, you get 3. Plus 5/8 plus 4/8, 5/8 plus 4/8 is 9/8, so you get 3 plus 9/8. Now it would be really strange to just say, OK, that's the same thing as 3 and 9/8, because you have a mixed number with a whole number and an improper fraction.
I want to make it a little bit straighter than that-- 1 shows up seven times. 2-- I'll do it in a different color-- 2 shows up five times.
2 plus 0 is 2.
And when x is 5, y is 0.4 times that. So it's y is equal to 2. And we said the equation is y is equal to 0.4 times x.
There is no other way to build 30, using some other groups of prime numbers multiplied together. So every possible number has one - and only one - prime factorization. A good analogy is to imagine each number as a different lock.
This is something I knew from past experience, and it's a good thing to know, in general, that a ton is 2,000 pounds. So I'm going to write it right over here. Now, how do we convert these 3/2 tons into pounds?
1x minus 0.25x. Well, that means that 0.75x is equal to the sale price, right? All I did is I rewrote x minus 25% of x as 1x minus 0.25x.
We are asked to approximate the principle root, or the positive square root 45, to the hundredths place, and I'm assuming they don't want us to use a calculator because that would be too easy. So let's see if we can approximate this, just with our pen and paper right over here.
So when I became Vulnerability TED, like an action figure --
So you could read this as 253 times 7 which we know is the same as 7 times 253. And now we are ready to compute. And there are many ways of doing this but this is what you could call the standard way.
Do we need the cup?
1 times 93 is 93. 170 minus 93 is 77. Bring down the 0.
Three minus three is zero. So on the left hand side we're left with just the question mark. And on the right hand side, we're left with ten minus three which is seven.
So plus 375. And now let's add up these numbers.
[This video has no audio narrations.]
So let's say, E for Elbert.
1 over 2 to the fourth power. Let me color code it nicely so you realize what the negative is doing. So this negative right over here, let me do that in a better color, I'll do it in magenta, something that jumps out.
So we have 1/2 times x minus y minus 4.
let me get it a little clearer might look like that if it was a right angle, then this line over here would be, would look something like that it would be completely upright relative to this, if this were the ground. but we don't see that this orange ray over here is actually opened out wider it's opened up wider so it is obtuse. it is obtuse so this kind of comes from the actual everyday meaning acute means very sharp or very sensitive obtuse means not very sharp or not very sensitive. you could imagine this looks like a sharp point or it's, it's not opening up much. so maybe it's more sensitive to you know, relative to other things
And one thing to think about AB and CD, well they don't even intersect, so we can't make a comment about them being perpendicular, but they are definitely not parallel You can even imagine that it looks like they are about to intersect.
Now it's useful on this page to limit the number of tasks you see here to the ones that are relevant for you. We already saw one way of doing that, you can click on Tasks in my language, but you can also use the Filter and Sort bar for this. There's an option here on the right part of the screen, you can click on it, and if you do, you will have an extra bar that appears, and that allows you to limit the tasks by type, say, I only want to see the reviews,
So 1 and 9/12 is the same thing as 12/12 plus 9/12, which is 21/12. So if I cut this into 21 blocks, each of them are going to be 1/12. Because this is 21/12 right over here.
It becomes 27 times 6 inches, and let's figure out what that is.
Thank you so much for coming to TED.
The square root of 4 is 2.
JK plus KL added together is going to be equal to the length of the entire thing. So we can say that 7x plus 9
OK. I think you might be able to figure this out on your own, but of course we'll do some example problems, just in case it's a little confusing.
We're on problem 66. And it says what is x squared minus 4x plus 4, divided by x squared minus 3x plus 2, reduced to lowest terms?
If you take 15 miles and divide it into 5 equal groups, you're going to end up with p. So what is this?
First we gonna have this expression: negative 5 plus something.So it's gonna be negative 5 plus the quantity of 4 times X. The quantity of 4 time X.That's gonna be 4X. So it's gonna be negative 5 plus 4X.
So this is the same thing as 1/5 times-- and I'm just going to write 3 and 1/3 as a mixed number. So it's 1/5 times 3 and 1/3 can be rewritten as 9/3-- sorry, I'm going to rewrite 3 and 1/3 as an improper fraction.
So 5 times 12 is 60. 60 times 9 is 540. And then in blue here, let's see.
Well, 9 times 5 is 45. And once again, the signs are different so it's a negative.
Regina rode her bike 2 and 1/4 miles from her house to school and then 1 and 5/8 miles to her friend's house. How many miles did Regina ride in total? So she first rode 2 and 1/4 miles, and then she rode 1 and 5/8 miles. then she rode 1 and 5/8 miles
2 times 4 is 8, plus 1 is 9.
How far is 5 away from zero?
There's this Greek word, "meraki" That means to really put your soul, put your entire being into what you're doing, whether it's your hobby or it's your work You're doing it with love for what you're doing But it's one of those cultural things, that I've never been able to come up with a good translation
If I put 2 there, I'd only have 2,000.
Negative 5 plus 3 is negative 2.
10 to the minus 1 is equal to 1 over 10, which is equal to 0.1. Switch colors, I'll do pink.
And we also know that the sum of the areas is 5.
So we say 1.25x is equal to 100. Not too hard. And after you do a lot of these problems, you're going to intuitively say, oh, if some number grows by twenty-five percent, and it becomes 100, that means that 1.25 times that number is equal to one hundred.
If angle ABC = angle ACB = angle CAB then all the angles are congruent to each other so equilateral triangle is one in which all 3 angles are the same . All angles add up to 180 so if we call the angle as x, then x + x + x = 180 or 3x = 180, so x = 60 degrees. In equilateral triangle are three angles are the same and are equal to 60 degrees
5 times 15 is 75. Subtract, no remainder.
Well it's 3 groups of 3. So I could write this as 3 groups. 3 × 3.
Let's see, if you add two you get to thirty. Then you add five, it's thirty-five. Seven times six, forty-two.
2*3 is 6, which is indeed equal to -1+7. Now I want to show you that over here we substituted. We had an expression or we had an equation that explicitly solved for x so we were able to substitute the x's.
28+7=35 which is the one that we just did. That is a check mark. And if you kept going, you said 38+7, that actually equals 45.
Nine over four. I want to give you an intuition for why this actually works. So two and one fourth, let's actually draw that, see what it looks like.
Multiply -8 times itself 3 times Well lets just do it
In the fourth term, you subtract negative 6 three times. So whatever term you're looking at, you subtract negative 6 one less than that many times.
3 is another prime number.
So if I where to say "what is 10 minus three y" And what does this equal when "y" is equal to two Well, every time you see the "y"
0 plus 7 is 7 which is less than 27.
And we could see, look 2 and 8, definitely that's not working out and it's interesting for people to think about why these aren't working out [Ben] Right, yeah, you can't divide two into nine
Well, we went 15 of the 39. 39 minus 15 is 24. So we have to go another 24 minutes before the hour.
And you let's say you think you're stationary.
3x to the third is the same thing is 3 to the third times x to the third. And then the last property, which we just stumbled upon is, if you have x to the a and then you raise that to the bth power, that's equal to x to the a times b. And we saw that right there. a to the third and then raise that to the fourth power is the same thing is a to the 3 times 4 or a to the 12th power.
Let me erase this.
So what is 4 - 3 equal to? Subtraction - or 'minus' - is the opposite of addition. So in addition, you're doing something more.
8 plus 36 would be 34, plus 20 is 54 feet. And then finally we have one last rectangle to deal with, this rectangle right over here, which is 15 feet long and 25 feet wide. And so now we can calculate the areas of the different rectangles.
5 goes into 21 four times. 4 times 5 is 20. Subtract.
The zero doesn't matter, so this is equal to 7 minus 7... which is equal to zero! Another way to think about it... Let's draw a number line
Well, it's 1,000 meters for every 1 kilometer.
So just like the last problem, I start with x and it grows by twenty-five percent, so x plus twenty-five percent of x is equal to one hundred, and we know this 25% of x we can just rewrite as x plus 0.25 of x is equal to one hundred, and now actually we have a level-- actually this might be
What is 2 times 34? And we could write it like this, literally. You'll almost never see it written like this, but it is
Then you have 4 hours, which is 240 minutes. 5 hours is 300 minutes.
All right, let's do line B. So line B, they say 4x is equal to negative 8, and you might be saying hey, how do I get that into slope-intercept form, I don't see a y. And the answer is you won't be able to because you this can't be put into slope-intercept form, but we can simplify it.
If you multiply both sides by 2/9, it's a positive number, so we don't have to do anything to the inequality. These cancel out, and you get x is less than 3 times 2/9.
5 times 25 is 125 plus 5 times 2y is 10y, plus all of this, 5y is equal to 350. 10y plus 5y is 15y. That's 15y plus 125 is equal to 350.
So let's just see how y changes with respect to changes in x. So when we go here, when x changes by 1, y goes down by 2.
So we could say, hey, Maple is approximately Old River, or M is approximately River plus 1,000. Or since we don't know the exact amount-- it says it's about 1,000 more, so we don't know it's exactly 1,000 more-- we can just say that in a normal year, Old Maple Farms, which we denote by M, has a larger amount of apples than River Orchard.
So it's 400 plus 390. Now we've got to multiply 18 times 54, or 54 times 18. So let's do that.
If you go on giving, soon you will be a beggar.
Well, what's remaining is 1, 2, 3 slices.
And you see that I just filled in four out of the eight sections, which is exactly half of this first whole. So we're making some progress. Now let's throw in 3/8.
All right, problem 79. What is the domain of the function shown on the graph below? That sounds like fancy word.
That's what 2 and 1/5 really is. Now if we're subtracting, that means we have to subtract 2 and we're subtracting the 1/5. Distributive property.
We're told that the total cost of filling up your car with gas varies directly with the number of gallons of gasoline you are purchasing. So this first statement tells us that if x is equal to the number of gallons purchased, and y is equal to the cost of filling up the car, this first statement tells us that y varies directly with the number of gallons, with x.
So this is today, 2 years into the future. Let me make a little chart. It's not the cleanest chart, but I think it'll do the job.
As far as I know, it doesn't look like there are any common factors between one fifty-one and one forty-three So we just get one fifty-one over one forty-three --We can write this as a mixed number
15 goes into 60 four times.
We have three different addition problems right over here... and what I want you to do (so you get the hang of things), is to pause the video and try them on your own. But as you do them, I want you to really keep in mind and think about what the carrying actually means. So I assume you've tried on your own, Now I'll work through them with you.
I'll now show you how to convert a fraction into a decimal. And if we have time, maybe we'll learn how to do a decimal into a fraction. So let's start with, what I would say, is a fairly straightforward example.
Five plus something is going to be equal to half the perimeter, remember the perimeter is all four sides. If we just took these two sides, which would be half the perimeter. So these two sides must be equal to, when you take their sum, must be equal to 17, half the perimeter.
12 times 7 is 84.
So it is 11-- let me do it in order-- 5 plus 0 is 5, 7 plus 5 is 12, 1 plus 1 is 2, bring down the 1.
And another way to think about it is we want hours in the denominator, we had seconds. So if we multiply by seconds per hour. There are 3600 seconds per hour.
We don't care about the actual height, or this altitude right over here, we just care about the lengths of the sides. So the perimeter of this parallelogram is going to be 12 inches, plus 8 inches, plus 12 inches, plus 8 inches.
I don't think it's any secret that if you'll have to do with any kind of science, you're going to be dealing with a lot of numbers. It doesn't matter whether you do biology or chemistry or physics, numbers are involved. And in many cases the numbers are very large.
So this would be equal to 9.9061. If you were to divide it by 100, which is actually the focus of this problem, so if we divide 99.061 divided by 100. If we move the decimal place once to the left, we're dividing by 10.
3 goes into 0 zero times.
Maybe 1 , -7, 0, 0, 5 and 10 And we can have some variable refer to it, so that we can refer back to it later on in the program, so maybe we say a is equal to all of this. And if we run this in the interpreter, or if we run this in a program, now we can refer to the elements of a, and you do that by, so let's say I have a (let me write in the same pink color)
90 - 20 is 70... Let's write a plus (+) there.
So this is the same thing is 59.2 ÷ 100. So if we if we were to take 59.2 - if we wanted to divide it by 10, we would move the decimal over to the left once. We would get 5.92.
27 divided by 3 is 9.
So let's give this a try.
Let's say it's 5x minus 4y is equal to 1.
15.25. Actually, is that right? I think I made a mistake here.
An altitude by definition is going to be perpendicular down here. Now, an isosceles triangle is perfectly symmetrical. If you drop an altitude from the the top, or the unique angle, or the unique vertex in an isosceles triangle you will split it into two symmetric right triangles.
The volume of the tank is going to be 9 foot by 5 foot times 12 feet. That's the volume of the tank.
That means for every, if you add up these two. For every eleven students there are four boys and seven girls.
At the airport, you can change your money from dollars into Euros. The service costs $5. and for every additional dollar, you get EUR 0.7.
Negative 8 divided by 2 is negative 4, negative 2x minus 4.
So the least common multiple of 12, 5 and 15 is 60.
Negative 1 is clearly not greater than 0, but you could even reason through that in your head. If she only gets 4 tokens for breaking 2 plates and she has to use up 5, she didn't gain tokens. What happens if she breaks 3 plates?
So we could have minus 6 times 4 is 24.
So we could say times 1 decigram is equal to how many grams?
You could view this as 4 plus 4 is equal to 8 but really, the reality of what we're doing since we're operating in the tens place this is really 40 plus 40 is equal to 80. And we could do the same problem expanded out. This is the same thing as 40 plus 6.
1 plus 2 plus 0 is equal to 3. Well, that'll satisfy our 3 divisibility rule, but 3 is not divisible by 9, so our number will not be divisible by 9. So 9 will not work out.
And then we want to multiply the negative 1 times each of these terms. So negative 1 times 9x is negative 9x, and then negative 1 times negative 6 is plus 6, or positive 6. And then that is going to be equal to-- let's distribute the 3-- 3 times 4x is 12x.
12 plus 5 is 17. And then that times 2 gets us the perimeter of 34. Now, given that, what is the area of this figure?
Does 2 go into 1? No.
A 1x, which is really just saying x over here Well, I'm dividing it by 3 right now So if I were to multiply both sides of this equation by 3 that would isolate the x
let's imagine negative 2 minus negative 3. And this might seem really intimidating to have all these negatives in place here. You just have to remember: subtracting a negative like this is going to get you a positive.
The first expression is only 268. The second expression, the number is a little bit smaller than 268, but it's that number squared. This is 243 times 243.
My name is Sal Khan I'm the founder and faculty of Khan Academy and we're trying to educate the world!
And it's a line, so it's going to have a constant rate of change of y with respect to x. So similarly, when x increases by 1, y is going to decrease by 2.
12 times 1/3 is the same thing as 12 divided by 3 which is equal to 4. Let's try one more. So here, we're told that 3a plus 5b is equal to 2.
The cube root of -512 is -8 And we are done And you can verify this
So we're going to have to divide both sides of the equation by negative 13. Now, what does the left-hand side become?
2 times 2, times 6 is 12. Subtract, you get a 0. 6 goes into 0 0 times.
Let's just say 291 times- let's try 3 out.
[WRlTES '0.30' TWlCE.] We get x is equal to 15/0.30. Now that's -
Let's add 4 to both sides of this equation.
5 goes into 6 one time.
I mean, 50,000 blogs are started a day, and so my blog was just one of those 50,000. And nobody read it except for my mom. Although I should say that my traffic did skyrocket and go up by 100 percent when she forwarded it to my dad.
What is 8 to the 2/3 power? Now that seems a little bit scary. And all you have to remember is this is the same thing, using our exponent rules really, as 8 squared to the 1/3 power.
6 times 2 is 12, plus 1 is 13. I have two numbers behind the decimal-- 13.5. So it's going to be 13.5.
(Cheering) They were happy because the story survived, and that the world would keep on spinning. Lothar Meggendorfer wasn't the first to evolve the way a story was told, and he certainly wasn't the last.
So let's just try out 5. 16 times 5 is 80, we subtract right over here. 8-0 is 8, 10-8 is 2, so we are left with 28.
2 and 1/4 divided by 1 and 3/4 is the same thing as 9/4 divided by 7/4. And we saw in several videos already that dividing by a fraction is the same thing as multiplying by its reciprocal. So this is equivalent to-- so these are all equivalent.
I have a 4, so I want to leave space for the 2, the 3, and put a 4 there. I have a 2. I have a 1.
When Al Gore won his well-deserved Oscar for the "Inconvenient Truth" movie, I was thrilled, but I had urged him to make a second movie quickly.
It'll go from 10/3, all the way down to negative infinity.
I've got five numbers here and the goal is to order them from least to greatest. And it might be obvious to you that all five of these numbers are negative numbers. So let's just think about which of these is the greatest number.
Now, let's do a little aside here to figure out what 117 divided by 3 actually is.
And now to isolate the y, we can divide both sides by positive 4. And we don't have to swap the inequality, since we're dividing by a positive number. So let's divide both sides by 4 over here.
30/50 plus 3/50 is 33/50 m is equal to-- and let's just simplify this a little bit --2/5 m plus 500.
Let's say the United States economy is going into a recession, or maybe even worse than a recession, and you are the chairman of the Federal Reserve and you need to do something about it. Well the first thing that you would do is that you would lower the Federal Funds Rate, and that's the rate that banks lend to each other overnight and the way that you lower it, if the banks don't do it on their own after you say you want to lower it is that you print money, as the Federal Reserve and you use it to buy, usually short-term treasury securities and that money gets deposited in banks, so the demand for reserves, because that's what these things are the demand for reserves goes down, and the supply goes up and the federal funds rate should go down.
O negative blood Well this is O and then within the blood group O This is O negative and we have 1 drop, 2 drops
Inboxes can be overwhelming. Unless you have the new Gmail inbox. One tab for social sites
3 times 25 is 75.
And then 400 plus 500 is 900. So we get to 972. And one more of these multiplications.
In the video on the Cambrian explosion I talked about how suprisingly, or somewhat surprisingly animals were the first to colonize or to move on land. They did that before plants did.
(Applause) One of the real challenges is to innovate fundamentally in education. Innovation is hard, because it means doing something that people don't find very easy, for the most part.
We only have to look at their numerators. Foe example, the smallest numerator is 80, so 4/9 is the least of these numbers.
There's actually a sphincter here or it's kind of like a valve that we call the lower esophageal sphincter that guards the entry way to the stomach. If that valve becomes leaky then food can actually leak up from the stomach and give us heartburn, that's where heartburn happens. Once food enters the stomach, it gets mixed with a bunch of other things that are secreted by the stomach.
And then Old Maple Farms has this value right here, which is 2/3M plus a. Everything said and done, Old Maple Farms still has more apples.
I only have the 3 to the right of the decimal. So I'm only going to have one number to the right of the decimal here. So I just count one number.
25 goes into 30 one time. And if we want, we could immediately put this decimal here. We don't have to wait until the end of the problem.
So in 2006, 80% liked Yummy, only 12% liked Thrill, and 8% didn't like either one or didn't have any preference. And so actually, just from here you see that many, many more people liked Yummy Cola than Thrill Cola, actually every year over years So Thrill
It's going to be -7 + 5, which is -2. So notice. x here is a variable, x here is the variable, and its value can change depending on the context. And this is in the context of an expression.
Is 13 equal to 2 times 10 minus 7?
Another way of thinking about it is, look, 1,000 millimeters is equal to a meter. So let's divide this into groups of 1,000. Well, this is literally 15 groups of 1,000.
produce large amount of Electricity. Teacher We have Solar Panels at our home.
And we are done.
(Laughter) But you clamp this thing on my head, and something happens. I just become skanky.
The 1 tells us how many of those pieces we're dealing with, so it's just this one piece over here. That right there is the 1/4. Now, if we write 5 and 1/4, we just saw that the 5 right here is 20/4.
And it is a process that can be energized and nurtured. But we had parents who said,
Now that we're comfortable with the "why" of why we do something to both sides of an equation, let's see if we can apply it to some equations to solve for an unknown variable.
(Laughter) And I was like, "Okay." And she said, "But the thing I liked about your talk is you're a storyteller.
Well, this is pretty straightforward. seven times two is fourteen. And how many total numbers do we have or how many total digits do we have behind the decimal point? Let's see.
10 to the minus 10. I think you'll find it reasonably satisfactory that this number is easier to write than that number over there. Now, and this is another powerful thing about scientific notation.
2 plus 7 is 9. 9 plus 7 is 16. 16 plus 7 is 23.
Notice multiplying by one half four times is the exact same thing as dividing by 2 four times. And in this situation, this would get you, well, one half, well, 1 times one half is just one half, times one half is 1 4th, times one half is 1 8th, times one half is 1 over 16. And so you probably see the relationship here.
48/64, and we want to write it in lowest terms, and we'll talk more about what lowest terms even means. Now, is there a way to group these 48 or these 64 into groups of numbers that will maybe simplify them a little bit? And to think about that, you'd have to think about what is the largest factor that is common to both 48 and 64?
So this number is going to be ten times more than this number.
Genes tell a cell how to function and what traits to express more specifically, gene regulators turn other genes on and off in different cells, to control cell function.
KlPP means Knowledge Is Power. It's an unbelievable thing. They have 66 schools -- mostly middle schools, some high schools -- and what goes on is great teaching.
And then I quickly point to him, I was like, look look. You can't just do one thing to one side of an equation. Then the equality won't be true anymore.
Nine plus negative ten equals two to the negative one, or we could say that equals one half, right? So it's an interesting thing here. Whatever is the bottom exponent, you could put it in the numerator like we did here, but turn it into a negative,
If you do anything to the left , we need to do the same thing to the right to keep it equal.
I could say that one times thirty-nine is equal to thirty-nine. And I think you're familiar with numbers this large by now. So that's interesting.
Now I want to figure out what 7 times 5 is. We know from our multiplication tables that 7 times 5 is equal to 35. Now, we can't just somehow put the 35 down here, we still have to deal with this 2 that we carried.
This is w plus 2w is 3w - 4w, 6w. So this is equal to 6w. That's the perimeter in terms of the width.
Four divided by two is equal to-- when you divide four into two groups, each group is going to have two quarters in it. It's going to be equal to two. And I just wanted to use this example because I want to show you that division is something that you've been using all along.
You've probably heard of people having a stroke, and you're probably familiar with the notion that it has something to do with the brain, and you'd be right. In particular, it's a rapid loss of brain function because of something strange happening with the blood flow to the brain. And let me show you that in a little bit more detail.
We're on problem 38. Which of the following best describes the graph of this system of equations?
A year before my husband died, 'Thermax' my company had gone public and our 400 rupee share had come down to 36. With the support of my daughter and her family and my excellent executive team, we managed to turn around the company.
What is the remainder when you divide 16 by 7?
4 times 0.25 (or 4 times 25% or times 1/4th), this is just going to be 1.
93 goes into 26-- about two times.
(Laughter) At some point around midnight, we were summoned to the wings of the stadium, and the loudspeakers announced the Olympic flag, and the music started -- by the way, the same music that starts here, the Aida March. Sophia Loren was right in front of me -- she's a foot taller than I am, not counting the poofy hair.
Get one hundred and eight plus y is equal to four times twenty-four. Well, four times twenty-five is one hundred.
15 goes into 75 five times exactly.
(24 hours of the day) that is 181 days!
'I did try that, but as soon as I step out of the house, my neighbors shut the doors and go inside.' And she said
Let's think a little bit about two terms that you'll see throughout your geometry, and really, mathematical career. One is the idea of things being perpendicular.
And since these are in the 10's place, this is really saying 60 - 40 = 20. And I'll make that a little bit clearer in a second. So we're actually done here.
Is there anything that we can do. Well the simple answer is just with this information here, there's actually very little.
All over the world, people separated by thousands of kilometers for thousands of years began meeting once again and producing children.
Well, if today, I, or Sal, if Salman, it's hard to speak in the third person. If Salman is one hundred years old today, in y years, Salman will be one hundred and eight plus y is equal to Sal in y years. We'll say y years.
3 divided by 3 is 1, and you're left with 2/3. So both of these fractions, when you simplify them, when you put them in simplified form, both end up being 2/3, so they are equivalent fractions.
Shelagh and Luana realize that they could express their ages more specifically if they used fractions. Doing this will allow them to calculate the difference in their ages more precisely.
There's this word in Chinese "Xiang" that kind of means smells good It can describe a flower, food, really anything But it's always a positive description for things It's hard to translate into something other than mandarin
Write 5.1/4 as an improper fraction Let me remind you an improper fraction is one where the numerator is gretaer than or equal to denominator, absolute value of numerator is greater than or equal to absolute value of denominator
Well, it's (COUNTlNG: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6) 7. So I had a total of 7 lemons.
You're going to have 4 in the denominator, and then the numerator is going to be 4 times 1, which is 4, plus 3, which is 7. So this is the exact same problem here.
Either way, 2/3 times 6 or 6 times 2/3, either way, that is going to be equal to 4. But there are two different ways of viewing this.
When 4 is a perfect square, you might already recognize that. We could further factor that into 2 times 2. But I don't think we need to.
Ten x is this. And it is another repeating thing. Now the way we can get rid of the repeating decimals is if we subtracting x from ten x, right?
There would be the most heat in the air at -7. Another way to think about it is we could draw a number-line. --So let's draw a number line right over here--
So our slope, change in y over change in x. I'll take this point 2 minus negative 4 over 4 minus negative 2.
We want to round to the nearest hundred, so you look at the hundreds place.
Then we'd have to break into his dorm room and then erase the tape?" (Laughter) And she goes, "Uh... no."
So when they ask us to write it in expanded form, we could write 14,897 literally as the sum of these numbers, of its components, or we could write it as the sum of these numbers. Actually, let me write this. This top 7 times 1 is just equal to 7.
Well, there are three thousand, six hundred seconds in an hour. sixty seconds per minute and sixty minutes per hour. So three thousand, six hundred over one seconds per hour. And these seconds will cancel out.
And you probably know, hey, well, if I take 2 away from 5, I'm going to get 3, so he used 2 flowers. The other way that you could think about doing it is, well, hey, we got only four options here.
(Laughter) And they said, "The world is still 'we' and 'them.' And 'we' is Western world and 'them' is Third World."
So 4j minus 100-- I just added all the constant terms-- has to be less than or equal to 500. And now this is a pretty straightforward inequality. Add 100 to both sides and we get 4j-- these cancel out-- we get 4j is less than or equal to 600.
If you divide by 10, that's the same thing as multiplying by 1 over 10. Well, anyway, the left-hand side, 1 over 10 times 10. Well, that equals 1, so we're just left with x equals negative 8 over 10.
Or another way of saying, this is 64 square meters. You might be asking where are those 64 square meters?
So eight times three is twenty-four. Stick the two up there. Eight times five is forty.
And that is going to be equal to the 3 x's. x plus x plus x. Now, we're dividing both sides of the equation by 3. We're dividing both sides of the equation by 3.
counterclockwise
So here, you have a ratio of 3 to 2. If you, if you triple the distance, we're tripling the time. If you multiply the distance by 5 or multiplying the time by 5.
Here we have one, two, three columns. Here we have one, two columns. Here we only have one column.
Welcome back. In the last video we were just figuring out the volume under the surface, and we had set up these integral bounds.
Welcome to the video on 'basic subtraction.' Let's do a little bit a review of 'basic addition' first. If I said '4 plus 3' (4 + 3), what would this mean?
5 times 20 is 100. And we are done.
4*20 = 80. So, 4/9 is the same thing as 80/180. Now, let's do 3/4.
And in general if you wanna work this out before I give you how I do it that now's a good time to actually pause the video. And you could, you could try to work it out and then, play it again and, and see what I have to say about it. But assuming you wanna hear it, let me go and do it.
And then 8 times negative 4 is negative 32. And now we've cleaned up the equation a good bit. Now the next thing, let's try to get all the x terms on the
And sometimes they found land and labor, and devised ways of exploiting both.
4 times 45, if I have 45 revolutions per minute times 4 minutes, (that's 160 plus 20) yep, that's 180. So these are all 45 revolutions per minute. You can multiply 5 times, 5 minutes times 45 revolutions per minute, you're going to get 225.
So, 9 is 33, so our LCM is going to have at least one 33 in it. And then 4 is the same thing as 2*2. So, we will also have 2*2 in our prime factorization (LCM).
And I actually think the people who lived there were called Magnetes. But anyway, you could Wikipedia that and learn more about it than I know. But anyway let's focus on what magnetism is.
Nine plus zero is nine.
27/2 is 3 times 9/2. So now we have 27/2 feet, and now we want to convert this to inches. And we just have to remember there are 12 inches per yard.
2 minus 3 and 1/4 is-- well, 3 and 1/4 minus 2 is 1 and 1/4, so this will be negative 1 and 1/4. But we're taking the absolute value of it, so we take the absolute value of it, which is equal to 1 and 1/4, which is indeed less than 2 and 1/2. Now let's try another number.
Welcome to the presentation on level four linear equations. So, let's start doing some problems. So.
Because what we do is we take fat from our butts and put it in our cheeks. (Laughter) Which just, I hope in 100 years, people will look back and go, "Wow."
And then the left hand side going to become 13 over 6x is equal to-- you're just going to have a 5 there. And then to solve for x, you just multiply both sides by the inverse of 13/6. 6/13.
7 times 3 is indeed 21. Same thing over here. Take x is equal to negative 4.
And then I have 1/4. So this last piece, this last whole, is divided into 8 sections.
2 is greater than.
that means they have gone cuckoo. A few will remain sane and try... but they will be stupid. Such chances rarely come in life.
And the cube root of 10, we just leave it as 10. We know the prime factorization of 10 is 2 times 5, so you're not going to just get a very simple integer answer here. You would get some decimal answer here, but here you get a very clear integer answer.
1 times anything is going to become that number! so it's equal to 1
And that space right there was unnecessary. But right here I've listed-- I've just rewritten those numbers and I've essentially categorized them. Now what I want to do is calculate how many of each of these numbers we have.
And even though there was a few months where it went down. The overall trend is that the price is going up. You can even see that.
8 plus 3 is 11. So if we do that-- let me do that in this direction. So if we do that, we get 4 times, and in parentheses we have an 11.
1x squared is the same thing as x squared. So plus x squared, and then these there's nothing really left to simplify. So plus 2x plus y squared.
In fact, I have a feeling that if Lehman Brothers was Lehman Brothers and Sisters, they might still be around.
Dell came out with MP3 players and PDAs, and they make great quality products, and they can make perfectly well-designed products -- and nobody bought one. In fact, talking about it now, we can't even imagine buying an MP3 player from Dell. Why would you buy one from a computer company?
And does that make sense?
3/2 is greater than 3/4. Let's do a couple more of these. One of the deepest points in the Indian Ocean, the Diamantina trench, is at negative 8 kilometers.
We already saw that, or 2 times 1/5. And 3 times 2/5 is literally the same thing as 3 times 2 times 1/5. In this case, that would be 6/5.
So after 4 days, she has $30. Then after 6 days-- I'm going to do the same color-- after 6 days she has $25. So x-coordinate is 6, y-coordinate is 25.
(Laughter) In the late 1980s, in a moment of youthful indiscretion, I went to law school.
Last year I showed these two slides so that demonstrate that the arctic ice cap, which for most of the last three million years has been the size of the lower 48 states, has shrunk by 40 percent. But this understates the seriousness of this particular problem because it doesn't show the thickness of the ice. The arctic ice cap is, in a sense, the beating heart of the global climate system.
7 times 12 we know is 84 from our times tables, or you could just think it's going to be 14 plus 10 times 7, which is 70. Either way.
But that would actually be the south pole, if you viewed the
Well, 5 plus 12 is equal to 17. And you can verify this.
Well, it's going to be 2 x 1,875 Well, 1,875 mL x 2
And 13 × 5 - Let's see.
Now if you divide that by 48-- 4,800 divided by 48 is 100. So Elbert is 44 times 100 meters high. So it's equal to 4,400 meters.
Negative 2x is, obviously, equal to negative 2x. You could do it either way. But if you add 3 to both sides of this equation the left hand side of the equation becomes just an x, because these two guys cancel out. x equal, and 6 plus 3 is 9.
All of that exciting stuff happens in the duodenum and after that, the small intestine continues and it continues on for anywhere from about 15 to 30 feet. It's really long and coiled up on itself. I'm drawing it kind of spread out, these coils of small intestine are actually all curled up on top of each other.
Three minus five is indeed equal to negative two.
And then the left-hand side, you're going to have, it could be a negative I plus P over 2, or you could just change the order, and you can write this as P over 2 minus l. And this is also an equally legitimate answer. And you're probably saying, hey Sal, wait.
Which side is perpendicular to side BC? So BC is this line segment right over here. And for another segment to be perpendicular to it, perpendicular just means that the two segments need to intersect at a right angle, or at a 90-degree angle.
0.00852. That's my first number. My second number is seven trillion, twelve billion.
3 1/8 is going to be right about there so let me just draw its absolute value 3 1/8, is going to be 3 1/8ths to the right of 0
Where's the b term? I don't see any b term.
48. 56.
You get negative 7y is equal to negative 3x plus 1. Now let's divide both sides by negative 7. You get y is equal to positive 3/7x minus 1/7.
Now sometimes when you see a proportion like this, sometimes you'll say oh you could cross multiply.
That's what that sentence tells us. eighty-five years ago, we're in this situation. Tarush, which is this, was ten times older than Arman.
Let's imagine negative 2,
Now, we're at 5.18 meters, and we want to now convert it to kilometers. So we're going to want meters in the denominator and kilometers in the numerator. Why?
Well, 60 minutes or 60 seconds per minute times 60 minutes is equal to 3,600 seconds. So that's interesting. Let's take things a little bit further.
So we've done this problem. And this problem is a PMT problem. However, what's given to you here?
This first line, 2 out of 3 students have a cell phone, so we could say that 2/3 x have cell phone. ...
Once again, the denominators are different. Find a common denominator.
So 120 is equal to 6 times what? Now, to be divisible by 6, you have to be divisible by 2 and 3. Now, we know that we're already divisible by 2 and 3, so we're definitely going to be divisible by 6, and you should hopefully be able to do this one in your head.
So the y-intercept here is 4. We didn't really graph this to scale. It would actually look a little bit more like this if we were to try to graph it properly.
And we can subtract four from there. So it's ninety-six.
An explosion too will happen.
Deflection does not return to zero.
We get 8, 9 plus 9 is 18, and then 1 plus 4 is 588.
Think of it as a special key or combination.
Negative sixteen is less than or equal to twenty, which is less than or equal to twenty.
The decorative use of wire in southern Africa dates back hundreds of years. But modernization actually brought communication and a whole new material, in the form of telephone wire. Rural to urban migration meant that newfound industrial materials started to replace hard-to-come-by natural grasses.
Residents were often given less than a month's notice before their buildings were razed. 600,000 people were displaced. The common perception was that only pimps and pushers and prostitutes were from the South Bronx.
Between 0 and 1, I've traveled 1 out of the 5 equal sections towards 1. And actually, let me make it a little bit neater than that. We could make the equal sections look a little bit better.
They have no idea who's been posing in what pose, and they end up looking at these sets of tapes, and they say, "We want to hire these people," all the high-power posers. "We don't want to hire these people. We also evaluate these people much more positively overall."
9 times-- I'll put negative 1 in parentheses-- minus 6 is equal to-- well, actually, let me just solve for the
And let's say I have a transversal right here, which is just a line that will intersect both of those parallel lines, and I were to tell you that this angle right there is 60 degrees and then I were to ask you what is this angle right over there? You might say, oh, that's very difficult; that's on a different line. But you just have to remember, and the one thing I always remember, is that corresponding angles are always equivalent.
And when I do that, 7 times x divided by 7-- that's just going to be x --and then 21 divided by 7 is equal to 3. So the solution to this equation is x is equal to 3. And you can verify it.
I need to make a confession at the outset here. A little over 20 years ago, I did something that I regret, something that I'm not particularly proud of. Something that, in many ways, I wish no one would ever know, but here I feel kind of obliged to reveal.
Seven times seven is forty-nine. Stick a nine there.
Or another way to think about is, 31-29 will give us the length of the white part and of course it's going to be negative. Because the negative number here is larger than the positive number. We are adding the two.
So nine goes into thirty three times. three times nine is twenty-seven.
Let me do more here-- 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, and then I'll throw another one here that looks a little bit different. I'll throw one here that looks like a Y, and we'll talk more about the X's and the Y chromosomes.
FAB, they're adjacent to each other and they clearly form a straight angle, which is 180 degrees when you add their two measures.
So for example, you could call this a 5 by 7 rectangle because that immediately tells you, OK, this side is 5 and that side is 5. This side is 7, and that side is 7. And for a square, you could say it's a 1-by-1 square because that specifies all of the sides.
How would cultural innovations helped a few of these groups to expand dramatically over the next several thousands years.
So how many students have a cell phone that is more than one year old? Well, we could take the total number that have a cellphone, which is 2/3 x. 2/3 of all the students have a cell phone.
Sal:For at least this case right over here, we're multiplying one times two 0 times, so the answer is one there. If you mulitply it by 2 once, you get a two there. and then if you do it by 2 twice, you get 2 times 2, is 4. So the prime factorization of 42.
Let us pretend that we do not know that it is equal to BC for an isosceles triangle, two sides have the same length the base angles will be the same. We know that angle ABC = angle ACB because side AB= side AC So if two sides are equal, base angles are equal
And they ask us, 150 is 25% of what number? They don't ask us to solve it, but it's too tempting. So what I want to do is first answer this question that they're not even asking us to solve.
That's 1, 2, 3 groups. 1, 2, 3.
Simplify 48/64 to lowest terms. Let's see if we can visualize this.
10 to the 0 has no 0's.
And then if you want to solve for l, you just have to divide both sides of the equation by 2! If you just divide both sides of this equation by 2 and we have isolated our l.
Rewrite the expression 4 times, and then in parentheses we have 8 plus 3, using the distributive law of multiplication over addition. Then simplify the expression.
Five times-- and you kind of do multiplication tables in your head-- Five times one is equal to five. Five times two is equal to ten.
We saw the food riots in 2008, after what I call the silent tsunami of hunger swept the globe when food prices doubled overnight. The destabilizing effects of hunger are known throughout human history. One of the most fundamental acts of civilization is to ensure people can get enough food.
I could start with m, and I could subtract 5. So we could say that 33, which is m, the amount of money Minli has, minus 5, is equal to the amount of money that James has.
So I'm going to redraw this angle right over here at the center of this protractor, so we can say if this is "Y", than "Z" goes right over here, and then the other ray, "ray YX" in this circumstance, will go roughly in that direction. And so it is pointing on the protractor to the--let's see this looks like it is the seventieth section, this is the eightieth section, so maybe this is, I would guess this is the 77th section, so this is pointing to right over here.
11 to 4, and then, 12 to 5.
Let's do multiplying something by negative three so we'll repeatedly subtract that thing three times whatever that thing is so now the thing isn't a positive two so the thing over here is a positive two but the thing we're going to subtract is a negative two So let me make it clear, this says we are going to subtract something three times, so we subtract something three times, so subtracting something (repeatedly) three times That's what this part right over here tells us and we'll do this, exactly three times
Let's factor out a 3 there. So it'd be 3 times to 2x squared, plus 7x-- or 21 divided by 3-- Plus 3.
I have something divisible by 2 into the denominator, so let me divide the numerator by 2, and this becomes a 1. Let me divide the denominator by 2, and this becomes a 3. And then you have 5 times 1 is 5, and 3 times 3 is 9.
Sixty-eight percent of Americans now believe that human activity is responsible for global warming.
John is making pasta dough. To make the dough, he mixed 3/2 cups wheat flour with 3/4 cups regular flour in some water.
I would make that a solid dot
Once again, 16's a perfect square, so we could stop there. If you didn't realize that, you would factor that as 4 times 4. You'd see that twice.
We could say 2 times minus 9 plus 3. 2 times minus 9 is minus 18 plus 3. Well, that is equal to minus 15. which is equal to what the original equation said.
And eleven minus five is six. And I have six plus - and the denominators are same here - so we're gonna get something over sixteen and twelve minus eight is four. So this is the same thing as six plus four over sixteen, which is the same thing as writing is a mixed number six and four sixteenths.
So, five goes into twenty-three four and three fifths times. Or another way of saying that is twenty-three over five is four and three fifths. Let's do another example like that.
You would be right in saying that they ate 5/8 of the pizza, because they ate 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 out of a total of 8 pieces. But that's not what this question is asking. They are asking, what fraction of the pizza is remaining?
(Laughter) And my life did end when that happened. And maybe the hardest part about my life ending is that I learned something hard about myself, and that was that, as much as I would be frustrated about not being able to get my work out to the world, there was a part of me that was working very hard to engineer staying small, staying right under the radar.
We have a 7 and a y. And this constant factor here, this number 7 that is multiplying the variable, also has a special name. It is called the coefficient of this term-- coefficient.
Let's say we have something like 3.257 repeating, and we want to covert this into a fraction. so once again, we set this equal to X, and notice: this is going to be 3.257, 257, 257... The 257 is going to repeat on and on and on.
So you see that 30 degrees plus x plus 2x, or x plus 2x plus 30 degrees, is going to be equal to 180 degrees. Now, we can simplify this. If we have one of something and then have another two of it, how much do we have now?
Let's try to learn a thing or two about ratios. So ratios are just expressions that compare quantities. So that might just be a fancy way-- let me just --of saying something that you may or may not understand.
It's definitely going to be smaller than 1, because 3 is smaller than 20. So let's throw some 0's on here.
The ice age not only created barriers, it also created bridges with so much water locked up in ice, sea levels dropped, exposing land and connected Siberia and Alaska, a few people in Siberia took advantage of this bridge, moving into present-day Alaska, and later, down into other parts of North America, maybe they followed migrating herds or maybe, they traveled in small boats, down the Pacific coast, or maybe they did both.
7 times 6 is 42.
Well, these two sides are gonna make up half the perimeter. If I wanted to figure out the whole one, I, I know this is also 8 and this is also 8.
And we have thirty-five girls.
Well, we can just go to the basic definition of what an exponent represents and say 5 to the sixth power, that's going to be 5 times 5 times 5 times 5 times 5-- one more 5-- times 5.
I have a triangle like this.
7 plus 7 plus 7 plus 7 plus 7, right? I have 7 five times. I added it to itself five different times.
But I wonder to myself, for those people that strap bombs to their chests and blow themselves up, how might they use 3D printers? Perhaps like this. You see, if you can print in metal, you can print one of these, and in fact
So 5 goes into 120. It doesn't go into 1.
And some there are fractions; this one right here is a proper fraction And this right here is a mixed number
The absolute value of 7 minus 2.
So you could literally just view this as 10 minus 7.
(Laughter) So you can't actually see them, but it was breathtaking, believe me.
10 and 12. And then we have one number left. We have 11.
So 5 times 4 is 20 minus-- let me stay consistent with the colors. Now let me write the next parenthesis right there, and then inside of it, we'd evaluate this first. Let me close the parenthesis right there.
Now, when we look at this number right over here, it has nothing in the tenths place.
(This refers to the six books concerned with planar geometry.) "...I then found out what 'demonstrate' means and went back to my law study." So one of the greatest American Presidents of all time felt that, in order to be a great lawyer, he had to understood---be able to prove any proposition in the six books of "Euclid's Elements" at sight.
Substract 15 minus 8 is 7
And when we say interbreed, literally they can produce offspring with each other, and the offspring are fertile.
But these genetic distinctions, are a relatively recent phenomenon in our history. We haven't been separated for very long.
The multiple of 100 above 152 is 200.
The reason why I'm here today, in part, is because of a dog -- an abandoned puppy I found back in the rain, back in 1998. She turned out to be a much bigger dog than I'd anticipated. When she came into my life, we were fighting against a huge waste facility planned for the East River waterfront despite the fact that our small part of New York City already handled more than 40 percent of the entire city's commercial waste: a sewage treatment pelletizing plant, a sewage sludge plant, four power plants, the world's largest food-distribution center, as well as other industries that bring more than 60,000 diesel truck trips to the area each week.
Overnight, I had to takeover the charge of our company and being a social worker by background, I felt most inadequate to assume this role.
They say 8 plus 4 is equal to 4 plus weird circle with the x thing. And what they're really wanting us to appreciate is that, look, 8 plus 4 is the exact same thing as 4 plus 8.
1 shows up seven times. So I'll do a little bar graph.
8 plus 0 is 8.
And so I said, "Here's the thing, I'm struggling." And she said, "What's the struggle?" And I said, "Well, I have a vulnerability issue.
25 goes into 0 zero times.
It's not less than 35. So x has to be less than 40.
Hi, my name is Jason Cornwell and I'm a User Experience Designer on Gmail.
The right-hand side, these two sevenx's will cancel out. And on the left-hand side we have minus sevenx plus x. Well, that's minus six plus two is equal to, and on the right all we have left is seven.
For the reciprocal of 7/4, you swap the numerator and denominator, or the top number and the bottom number, and you get 4/7. Now, we could just multiply these. We could just say this is 9 times 4, which would be 36, over 4 times 7, which is 28, and then try to put it in
I'll write it like this, 1 stamp. How much would 10 stamps cost? Well, if 1 stamp is $0.44, then 10 stamps, we could move the decimal to the right one place, and so it would be, and now this leading zero is not that useful, so it would now be $4.4.
Complete the table to show equivalent measurements in feet and inches. So they gave us the measurements in feet and they want us to figure out how many inches this number of feet are. So we know that one foot is equivalent to twelve inches so we can fill that first one right over here.
To go from 27 to 351, we have to multiply by 13. So to go from 7 to whatever numerator here, we're going to have to multiply by 13. 7 times 13 is 70, plus 21 is 91.
So you just multiply 1/2 times 3/4, and this is equal to-- you multiply the numerators.
We're asked to move the orange dot to -0.6 on the number line So the point, the dot, right now is at zero... and let's see this is -2, this is positive 2. So, each of these big slashes looks like it's 1
In compound interest now, we don't take 10% of the original amount. We now take 10% of this amount. So now we're going to take $110.
Janelle is training for a road race. Her pedometer tracks how far she runs every day.
It is 441. 35 squared. Once again, I'm tempted to use a calculator, but I won't.
structure.
Well that's bigger than fourteen, so I have to go back here. So five only goes two times. So it goes two times.
108.1%--ignore this for now because we just used that to do the work. It's 108.1% is equal to 1.081.
Now what's happening here?
8/36 = 10/45. Another way to think about it is, what do we have to multiply 8 by to get its denominator?
And then new numerator is going to be eighteen times six or six times eighteen, plus seventeen.
I believe we're living at a time in human history where it's just simply unacceptable that children wake up and don't know where to find a cup of food. Not only that, transforming hunger is an opportunity, but I think we have to change our mindsets. I am so honored to be here with some of the world's top innovators and thinkers.
So when people say x-intercept, that's the x-coordinate when y equals 0. Well, they gave us the x-intercept. So that right over there is the x-intercept.
We're asked to multiply 65 times 1. So literally, we just need to multiply 65, and we could write it as a times sign like that or we could write it as a dot like that but this means 65 times 1. And there's two ways to interpret this.
So let's subtract minus 6z there, and that, of course, equals minus 6z there. And what do we get? On the left hand side, we get 9/16 minus 6.
So we want to do the 3 times 3 before we add the 7.
So let's say dollars you give them. And how many Euros do you get? I'll just put a bunch of random numbers.
You get 0 is equal to 0, which is always going to be true. This type of system is called a dependent system. So remember, when you get a nice clean solution, that's a consistent system.
26 times 15.
So you could view this, you could view this, as a coefficient, so this is also a coefficient, so let me make it clear-- these three things are coefficients. Coefficients. Now the last part, they want us to identify the exponent of each term.
Let's think a little bit about what it means to multiply 2/3 times 6. One way to think about it is to literally take six 2/3 and add them together.
Well, that's 11. So we're left with the 20-- let me write it all down again. We're left with 8 plus 20 minus 6 plus 5, which is 11, plus 44.
Let's say that's -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3. X is greater than negative 2. It does not include negative 2.
OK, that's going to be the same thing as 3 times 1 over 4 times 3. Divide the numerator and the denominator by 3 and you get 1/4.
Well, it's 10,000 plus 6,000. It's going to become 16 thousands. This right over here is going to become a 16.
If we are going from 3 cups to 9 cups of oatmeal how much more oatmeal we are using? we are using 3 times more , 3 x 3 = 9 If we want to use flour in the same proportion we need to use, 3 times the flour we need flour times 3 ; 2x3 = 6 cups of flour Another way to think about it
There's no such thing." (Laughter) So I'm a researcher-storyteller, and I'm going to talk to you today -- we're talking about expanding perception -- and so I want to talk to you and tell some stories about a piece of my research that fundamentally expanded my perception and really actually changed the way that I live and love and work and parent.
So what is 48/64 in lowest terms? We want to write this in as simple as possible fraction. Well, if we make each of the pieces equal to 16 of our old pieces, if we make this into one piece, if we turn 16 into one, then we are talking about instead of 48/64, we're talking about three.
3 goes into 27 nine times.
So two minus two thirds Two minus two thirds Is the same thing as two can be rewritten as six thirds six divided by three is two minus two thirds
But 5 to the third power, 5 times itself three times, is equal to-- well, 5 times 5 is 25, and then 25 times 5 is 125, so this is equal to 125. And we're done!
6 is the same thing as 2 times 3.
left-hand side becomes negative 14, is less than-- these cancel out-- less than negative 5x. Now let's divide both sides by negative 5. And remember, when you multiply or divide by a negative number, the inequality swaps around.
We're also subtracting a 0.7 from 0.2. So we're going to have to regroup a little bit in the numerator in order to subtract. Or at least, in order to subtract using the most traditional technique.
We're dealing with huge swathes of time. eighty-five years ago.
and in general what we have when we have two rays with the exact same vertex, you have an angle. and
So, the feet cancel out with the feet and I am left with 9 x 1/12, which is 9/12 seconds and 9/12 seconds is the same thing as 3/4 seconds which is the same thing as 0.75 seconds for the squirrel to cross the street Now, let's think about the car So, now let's think about the car.
So this is going to be 18 plus, and then over 60, we have 5 plus 24, which is 29. 29 plus 12, let's see, 29 plus 10 would be 39 plus 2 would be 41. It would be 41.
(Laughter) (Applause) So this decentralized, demystified approach of solar-electrifying villages, we've covered all over India from Ladakh up to Bhutan -- all solar-electrified villages by people who have been trained. And we went to Ladakh, and we asked this woman -- this, at minus 40, you have to come out of the roof, because there's no place, it was all snowed up on both sides -- and we asked this woman,
4*45 = 180. Now, you also have to multiple the numerator by 45.
This is 4 divided by 4. And we know that any number divided by itself-- except for 0. 0 is a little bit strange.
And if I had to write 7 times x equals 14, if I write my sign of "times" or my x so a bit strange, it may seem as xx "or" times "times" So usually when you're dealing with equations, especially when one of the variables is an x, you would not use the traditional sign of multiplication You can use something like this--you can use the point to represent the multiplication
What do you think 2 to the negative, negative 4 power is? And I encourage you to pause the video and think about that. Well, you might be tempted to say, oh, maybe it's negative 16 or something like that.
On the one hand I welcome it; on the other hand there is so much fear about whether I'll come out of it.
So just as a reminder of what the y-intercept even is, if you imagine a linear function or a line if we're graphing it, if we imagine a line, so let's say that is our line right over there. This is our y-axis. This is our x-axis.
So, if we divide 15,000 mL into 8 equal sections, each pitcher is going to have exactly 1,875 mL So, that's 1,875 mL But that's not we're asking us for
5 goes into 20 four times.
Let's say this entire angle here-- I'm drawing it really big-- that's 90 degrees. Right? They're perpendicular.
I actually wrote it down as an example. negat .. 1/3 is not an integer for the same reason that 0.3 is. It's not one of these natural counting numbers, their negatives or zero
So 25 doesn't go into 1, doesn't go into 15, it goes into 150, what is that? Six times, right? If it goes into 100 four times, then it goes into 150 six times.
Which of course means "Criticism, Rejection, Assholes and Pressure." (Laughter) So, the answer to this question is simple:
So it's probably worthwhile for us to understand some of the properties of the circle.
And subtracting-- let me write this subtraction sign in blue-- and then we're subtracting 2 and 1/5, but 2 and 1/5 is the exact same thing as 2 plus 1/5.
You could say a gold coin is worth a dollar, so it's a million gold coins. We know that that's not true anymore. And I use that essentially to build this big structure of solid stone that looks really safe and really secure.
"The Wheels on the Bus Go Round and Round." Well, we heard that one too, but "Pioneer Germ Fighters" totally rules.
(Laughter) Well, I do.
And then those parts of the body start to take over and start taking over all of the cells. And this process is called the cell has-- this is one of the hardest words for me to say, something wrong with my brain-- but the cell has metastasized.
Let's make it equal to -6 Now let's run our program to see what happens. We get -246.
So if something shrinks by twenty-five percent, that means it's just going to be 0.75 or 75% of what it was before, right? one minus twenty-five percent.
And they're going to be equivalent. So this right here is 60 degrees. Now if this angle is 60 degrees, what is the question mark angle?
Because we have the minus 7 times minus 11, so it's plus 77.
(Applause) (Children singing) Man 9: Google, say "delicious" in Thai.
If "x" were seven, this would be two times seven, or fourteen And the most traditional way of doing it is to just write the x right after the 2. And sometimes this will be read as "2x"
In cross multiplication, whenever you set a proportion
A recipe for oat meal cookies calls for 2 cups of flour for every 3 cups oatmeal. How much flour is required for a big batch which uses 9 cups of oatmeal. So 2 cups of flour for every 3 cups of oatmeal.
And then finally, after 8 days, she has $20. And so we've plotted those points, and we could connect them. We could actually just, if we had a nice ruler, we could just connect two of those, and we would have the line.
-- let me do it in a different color -- 6.4 times 10 to the minus 6 times 3.2 times 10 to the 11th. Which we saw in the last video is equivalent to 6.4 times 3.2. I'm just changing the order of our multiplication.
So 3 goes into 225. It goes into 22 7 times.
8 times 3 is 24.
And by that first rule we learned, this would be two to the two hundred ninth. Now in the next module I'm going to cover this in more detail. I think I might have just confused you.
10 minus 2.35. 7.65. And that is going to be equal to 0.75m.
"I can put the wash on the line, pack the lunches, hand out the kisses and be at work at five to nine. I can bring home the bacon, fry it up in the pan and never let you forget you're a man." For women, shame is, do it all, do it perfectly and never let them see you sweat.
336 plus x is equal to 440. Well, it turns out if you subtract 336 from both sides, you get x is equal to 104. So unless you have a exam that has some bonus problems on it, it's probably impossible for you to get ah an 88 average in the class after just the next exam.
And exactly what I drew is choice A.
Identify complementary and supplementary angles in the image below So, just as a reminder: Complementary angles are two angles that add up to 90 degrees, and supplementary angles add up to 180 degrees.
It does go into 150.
Eighteen (18) divided by two (2)! And this is a little bit of a trick question. This is what you knew how to do before we even talked about negative numbers:
We need to move it to 1, 2 of them.
What's 0.005 times 1,000? That's a 5. So 7.345 times 1,000 is equal to 7,345.
So 4 times 5 is 20 square roots of 5. And once again, this is irrational. Well, let's do F.
So ten times two is twenty. Or you say one times two is two, but you're putting it in the tens place, so you still get twenty. So ten times two is twenty.
-2, -3, -4 and -5 and he says 'Well anything i can associate I can associate each of these pairs of values with a point in two-dimensions. I can take the x co-ordinate, I can take the x value right over here and I say 'Ok that's -2 that would be right over there along the left right direction, i'm going to the left because it's negative.' and that's associated with -5 in the vertical direction. so I say the y value's -5 and so if I go 2 to the left and 5 down.
because the reading of your questions is preparing people.
But then when you evaluate it, 4 times 8-- I'll do this in a different color-- 4 times 8 is 32, and then so we have 32 plus 4 times 3.
And 10 to the sixth is just 1 million. So it's 1.765244 times 1 million, which makes sense.
3 times 6 times 10. And when you're multiplying three numbers like this, it doesn't matter what order you multiplay them in. So we could multiply the 3 times the 6 first and get 18 and then multiply that times 10.
Now, 3/4 means that I've gone 3 out of the 4 spaces towards 1.
So you can say a=3+5, then we can say b=a*a-a-1 [note: * means "times", it is used for multiplication.] and then you can say c=a*b Then you can have something like... I will put some space here just to make it a little bit cleaner. c = a*b
And this problem says that twenty percent of x is equal to four. I think now it's in a form that you might recognize. So how do we write twenty percent as a decimal?
What if it was negative 2 times positive 2? Well in this case, let's first of all look at the two numbers without signs.
Considering that I have a cold right now I can't imagine a more appropriate topic to make a video on than a virus Don't make it that thick. A virus, or viruses.
18 plus 7 is 25. So we get 252. So I'm saying the common denominator here is going to be 252.
1 1 is the only common factor
120 is equal to 8 times 15, so let's add that to our factor list. We now have an 8 and now we have a 15.
2/5, if we multiplied the numerator and denominator by 5, this becomes 10/25. Right? So our whole equation is now 33/50 m is equal to-- what is 10 minus 2?
I mean we could distribute this negative 1 and all that, but let's just do straight up order of operations here. So let's evaluate this expression. We want to do multiplication before we add anything.
There's a whole bunch of fossils, and here's examples of it. From species that were around between 200 and 300 million years ago. And their fossils are found in a very specific place.
What's the largest power of 10 that fits into this number? That this number's divisible by? Let's think about it.
Dwolla is a pretty straight forward business model.
196 is 2 times 98. Let's keep going down here.
98 is 2 times 49. And, of course, we know what that is.
So, 1 to 1, and when you double the distance, we double the time. When you triple the distance, when you tripled the distance from one, you didn't triple the time. So table three doesn't make sense either.
And when you multiply both of them by 100, you can't just multiply one of them, [because] then you'd get a different answer. But if you multiply both of them by 100, you move this decimal point over two spots, so it becomes a 30 - And you move this decimal point over two spots - so it becomes 1500.
And then x is equal to, let me see. five goes into seventy. one times five. twenty-six. five times five is twenty-five. fifteen.
So remember, a rhombus is just a parallelogram, where all four sides are equal. In fact, if all four sides are equal, it has to be a parallelogram. Just to make things clear, some rhombuses are squares, but not all of them, because you could have a rhombus like this, that comes in where the angles aren't 90°.
So if we want to get to 45, the, the 6.7 squared is still less than, the square root, or I should say, 6.7 squared is still less than 45. Or 6.7 is still less than the square root of 45. So, let's try 6.71.
And if you add all of these together, 4/8 plus 3/8 plus 1/8, you are going to get, in terms of eighths, 4/8 plus 3/8 plus 1/8 is going to be 8/8.
We have 12 , and -12 is the opposite then we have -55, the opposite is positive +55 or 55 opposite of -3 is the positive 3 , almost done opposite of -5 is the positive 5 opposite of 21 is -21 and then opposite of -12 is positive 12
Write the 4, regroup the 1 into the ones place.
8 goes into 40 five times.
The rate of increase as x changes is going up.
And the same thing would happen here 3*1/3 is just 1 So you get 1x is equal to 14*3 which is 42 now let's just check our answer let's substitute 42 into our original equation
In 40 years, he's going to be 11 times as old as he is right now. So this is going to be times 11. You take x and multiply it times 11, you're going to get how old he is in 40 years.
5+-5 : 5+ the - of 5: or 5 + the additive inverse of 5 you can just view this, and as another way as 5 - 5 and if you have 5 of something then you take you take away 5 then you learned many many years ago that, that is going to get you 0
CA: Are you going to come back to India with some of this, at some point?
2/3 times 6 can be viewed as-- well, how many do I have if I take 2/3 of 6? Now, what we want to do now is apply that same idea, but to multiply not a fraction times a whole number, but a fraction times a fraction. So let's say that we wanted to take 3/4 and multiply it by 1/2.
If we look at point C, once again there is no point after C to specify it as a ray, we can have a ray CE, starts at C goes through E and goes on for ever, you can also have a ray starting at C, going through F and going on forever, CE &amp; CF are the same rays as F sits on ray CE and E sits of ray CF, so CE &amp; CF are the same rays, now lets think about what we can do from point E,
1 times 25 is 25, and then we can subtract.
So that leads us to the second exponent rule, a simplification is we could just say that this equals two to the nine minus ten, which equals two to the negative one. Let's do another problem like that.
--Fifty-two plus a hundred would be one hundred and fifty two And this is going to be one less than that So it's going to be one hundred and fifty-one
Even love needs help from technology.
So, let's never forget, whether at TED, or anywhere else, that whatever brilliant ideas you have or hear, that the opposite may also be true. Domo arigato gozaimashita.
Then 3 divided by 3 is 1. And that should be what 3 to the zeroth power is. So that's one way to think about it.
So we have two sets of constraints on the set of x's that satisfy these equations. x minus 4 has to be greater than or equal to negative 5 and x minus 4 has to be less than or equal to 13.
While the 5 is in the hundredths place, so it literally represents 5 hundredths. So that's one way to represent it. But then we can start to rearrange value amongst these two place values.
9 does not work out. So let's move on to 10. Well, this is pretty straightforward.
While I was doing my tiny little bit of analysis to figure out whether the basic or the trial plan made sense, and we did this whole analysis of saying well, at what number of sessions does the trial plan give me the same cost as the basic plan? And I did this whole calculation and said it was at five sessions.
This is the hundreds place so you look at the 5 right there, and if this number is 5 or greater, if it's 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9, you round up.
Now let's think about the supplementary angles. so supplementary angles
2 times 5 is 10.
Well, 9% literally means 9 per 100. So we could rewrite this as-- so this is going to be equal to 1/3 plus, instead of writing 9%, I'll write that as 9 per 100, and then once again times 1/3.
So, six and seventeen eighteenths is equal to one hundred twenty-five over eighteen. Let's do a couple more. And in a couple minutes I'm going to teach you how to go the other way, how to go from an improper fraction to a mixed number.
And let's say we know the following. And we know that AB is equal to 7, and we know that BC is equal to 5. And we want to know, what is the perimeter of ABCD?
1...1 group...1 group of 12 here. So we could literally say 1...1 times 12...
So let me divide it into fourths first.
label it DE, and lets also have line segment, FG and lets say the point where the two line segments interact is H, how could we specify this angle right over here can we call it as angle H, if we say it as angle H, it could be this angle, that angle or this angle over here it could be this angle over here.
And with the left-hand side, 2 plus 25 is 27 and we're going to get 27 is greater than. The right-hand side of the inequality is negative 12y. And then negative 25 plus 25, those cancel out, that was the whole point, so we're left with 27 is greater than negative 12y.
Cent means 100, so it literally means 109 per hundred. If you had 100 per 100, you're dealing with the whole, but now we have more than a whole.
And now we subtract. So the difference in their ages is going to be-- the denominator is going to be 12.
So e is 1/13 times 1 over 11. Well, we just multiply the numerators. We get 1 over whatever 13 times 11 is.
7 is how far away from 0? It is 7 away from 0. So the absolute value of 7 is equal to 7.
Uh oh, we don't have-- We can't do 0 minus 1. We can regroup, or we can borrow. So this will become a 10, which is really a 1.
Well, I'm adding 0. I'm adding nothing, so it's still just going to be 5,524. By what number can we multiply 8,895 to get 1?
But isn't this also the same thing as 2 times the inverse of 2, which is 1? I'll show it to you.
If you divide negative 16 by 8, you get negative 2, times 3 is a negative 6.
Well this thing must be equal to 400. Or, formally, subtract 320 from both sides of this. And you would get 400 is equal to 2w.
Well, we could try to visualize that. If 1 minute-- so let's say that is 1 minute-- if that is equal to 60 seconds, then 5 minutes-- let's just make five copies of this.
Here in this one there&amp;#x27;s an eye over here: 1, 2, 3, 4 ,5, 6, 7, 8. And i&amp;#x27;ve never even realised that this is quite creepy.
So the 2 is below the 8 - (They're both in the 1's place.) - and the 4 is below the 6.
I think you're ready at this point to try some level 1 equations Have fun!
So we're going to be 10 to the left of zero, or -10. Or another way to think of it... Lemme draw the number line there (always better to have the visual).
Fill in the table with whole numbers to write 0.25 in different ways.
And here, a company which licensed this herbal pesticide put a photograph of the innovator on the packing so that every time a user uses it, it asks the user, "You can also be an innovator. If you have an idea, send it back to us." So, creativity counts, knowledge matters, innovations transform, incentives inspire.
Let's pretend that I'm living in London in the early 1800s right as the Industrial Revolution is starting. Life is swell. My light colored body lets me blend in with the light colored lichens and tree bark, which means that birds have a hard time seeing me, which means that I get to live.
So this is the same thing as 3. So we know that 23 over 6, which is the same thing as 18 plus 5 over 6, is the same thing as 3 plus 5/6. Or, if we want to write it as a mixed number, we could write it as 3 and 5/6.
10 to the minus 3. 10 to the minus 3 is equal to 1 over 10 to the third, which is equal to 1 over 1,000, which is equal to 0.001. So the general pattern here is, 10 to the whatever negative power is however many places you're going to have behind the decimal point.
5 times 210 is 1,050-- minus 1,050 is equal to 41,790. And then you could add 1,050 to both sides. And so let me do that, 1,050 to both sides.
So I want to start by offering you a free no-tech life hack, and all it requires of you is this: that you change your posture for two minutes. But before I give it away, I want to ask you to right now do a little audit of your body and what you're doing with your body. So how many of you are sort of making yourselves smaller?
-1,-2,-3,-4 and I can go on now we wanna graph all of the Xs that are less than 4 but we're not including 4 it's not less or equal than 4 it's less than 4 and to show that we're not including 4 what we're going to do is that we're going to draw a circle around 4 so this shows us that we're not including 4 if we were including 4
1 times 11 is 11. Subtract.
So I'm saying I'm going to put parentheses right there and right there and let's work it out. You would get 8 minus 4 is 4. So this whole thing was simplified to 12 minus 4 times 5.
If we were to just draw a line right down here you'd see that for every block in Model A you have 1, 2, 3, 4 blocks in Model B.
I also knew that I'm not alone. We as a society are eating twice as much meat as we did in the 50s. So what was once the special little side treat now is the main, much more regular.
(Applause) I plan to work more on pollution and environment because I want to save this world and to save this environment where we all live in. Thank you very much.
Now, on the blue one, to go from 2 to 12 in the denominator, we have to multiply by 6, so we also have to multiply by 6 in the numerator.
6 is not prime, because it's divisible by 2 and 3. I think you get the general idea. You move to 7, 7 is prime.
What is 21 times 1 over 7? It's equal to 21 over 7.
So let's draw fourteen objects.
10 minus 7 is 3. So this becomes a 3, so the entire expression becomes negative 1. Negative 1 times...
So we get 0.7x, or we could say 0.70 if you like. Same number.
So, this boils down to nine times five plus thirty two. So our Fahrenheit degrees are going to be nine times five is forty five plus thirty two degrees or it's equal to forty five plus thirty two is seventy seven. So this is seventy seven degrees Fahrenhiet.
I could sit and I could put a smile on my face. I wanted to model. I wanted to see what it was all about, to have my pictures somewhere out there.
I thought in getting up to my TED wish I would try to begin by putting in perspective what I try to do and how it fits with what they try to do. We live in a world that everyone knows is interdependent, but insufficient in three major ways.
-9(-1) - 7(7) and so this is equal to-- we're in the home stretch--
Well, 33 minus 5 is going to be 28. So we can say that James has, 28 is equal to j, or James has $28.00.
We get 5 minus 1 is 4. We want to-- let me write this a little bit neater here. Minus 441.
(Laughter) And then I got excited when it started getting tens of hits, and then I started getting excited when it started getting dozens and then hundreds and then thousands and then millions. It started getting bigger and bigger and bigger.
And let's see, if I add 8/22 to that, then that's going to get me to--let's see, 16 plus 8, that gets me to 24/22. This is 16/22 plus 8/22 is going to get me 24/22. And if I get one more, that gets me to 25/22.
This house is 581 ... We have to start collecting from 555. Girls and boys in Hyderabad, going out, pretty difficult, but they did it.
To show that we're going to do all of the values less than 4 we'll shade in the number line below 4 going down from 4 just like that just like that and we can shade in the arrow just like that here is all of the values less than 4 and you can test it out take any value where there is blue so there is blue overhere
137 is going to be right over there. So two options-- we can round down to 100. That's the multiple of 100 below 137.
So you get 5 times q minus 7 is equal to 8. And then instead of dividing both sides by 5, which would get us pretty close to what we were doing over here, let me distribute this 5, I just want to show you, you can do it multiple legitimate ways. So 5 times q is 5q.
5y is equal to minus 10x plus 15. So they are the same lines. So that's A, two identical lines.
You could compare 11/16 to 6/16. Well, if you have the same denominator and this numerator is greater, 11 is greater than 6, 11/16 is going to be greater than 6/16, which is the same thing as 3/8. And we got it right.
Now let's bring the 7x over onto the left-hand side. And we could do that by adding 7x to both sides, 7x. This is a review.
left is pounds. And if you do it this way, you'll never get confused. You'll know that the units cancel out so you're getting the right units.
And we know that 15% is the same thing as 15 per 100. That's literally per cent. Cent means 100, which is the same thing as 0.15.
We're asked to identify which expression is larger.
I could draw the number line and maybe that's 16 maybe that's 17. It's 15, 14, 13, 12, let me go down all the way to 11. I could keep going but I've run out of space.
3x to the third is the same thing as 3 to the third times x to the third. That's what this is saying right here.
Two and one fourth is the same thing as nine fourths. And this will work with any fraction. So let's go the other way.
68 goes into 70 one time.
And now we're just on the level 2 to level 1 problem And you could just multiply both sides of this equation times their reciprocal on the coefficient of 2 X. Some people would just say that we're dividing by 2, which is essentially, what we're doing.
You're multiplying 2 times the entire quantity a plus 2b. You have to distribute that 2. This is going to be equal to 2 times a plus 2 times 2b, which is equal to 2a plus 4b.
I heard other words: "cancer," "stage," "grade."
And if you were to try to somehow solve this equation, subtract 5x from both sides, you would get negative 8 is equal to negative 8, which is absolutely true for absolutely any x that you pick. So let's go-- let me actually fill this in on the exercise. So I want to make 5-- it's going to be 5x plus negative 8.
And so we're left with 1/3 plus 300 times 1/1. Well, that's just going to be 3/100. So this is just going to be equal to 1/3 plus-- I'll write this in orange still, or maybe I'll do it in a new color-- plus 3/100.
The minus 3, or the negative 3 plus the 3, those will cancel out. That'll just be 0. And then that will be equal to 7 plus 3, which is 10.
5 times 16 is 80. You subtract, you have no remainder, and you're done. 4/16 is the same thing as 0.25.
To go from 9 to 3, you divide by 3. So to go from this exponent to that exponent, maybe we should divide by 3 again. And that's why, anything to the zeroth power, in this case, 3 to the zeroth power is 1.
"Father, have you forsaken me?" A great doubt must have arisen in him, a great question. Nothing is happening, and he was believing all these years that God would come to save him, his only begotten son.
85/13 Is equal to b. And now we just have to subtract these two numbers. So 8 is the same thing as-- let's see.
So 1,715 can be factored into 5 times 343.
2 over 3 times 12 over 1 is equal to-- if you divide that by 3, you get a 4, divide that by 3, you get a 1-- is equal to 8.
So if Arman is x, that tells us that Tarush is going to be fivex. eighty-five years ago. So, eighty-five years ago, well, Arman is x today, then eighty-five years ago,
This 5 right over here is in the hundredths place. So you could view that as 5 × 1/100. So if I were to rewrite this,
I can re-write a hundred as one plus ninety-nine. I can re-write ten as one plus nine. And so two times a thousand is the same thing as two times one plus nine-hundred ninety nine.
So we could go back to what we have, we could go back to this...we could go back to this... and we saw that 14 over 9 is eq... 14 over 9 times r is equal to p. If we wanted to solve for 14 over 9, we could divide both sides by r and you would get 14 over 9 is equal to p over r. Not p times r.
You might say that "Oh well, let me take the Y from both sides" You might take this Y block up. But if you take this Y block up you have to take away Y from this side and you don't know what Y is. And if you think about it algebraically you might get rid of the Y here.
Find the sum of 15 plus -46 plus 29. So lets just think about the first part over here We have 15 plus -46, we will worry about +29 later on.
It is going to be 100 degrees. So if we draw our pie again, if we draw our half pie, you have 30 degrees for your mom. So that's 30 degrees for your mom.
First consider the expression for: negative 5 plus the quantity of 4 times X,
Welcome to Level 2 Linear Equations! Let's do a problem.
It does go into 11, three times.
I'm going to share with you the story as to how I have become an HlV/AlDS campaigner. And this is the name of my campaign: SlNG Campaign.
Handsome Jack is buying a pony made of diamonds. The price of the pony is P dollars. And Jack also has to pay a 25% diamond pony tax.
But for the rest of my life, if I meet John Hodgman at a TED party, I don't have to say,
DHF. now are are clear which angle you are referring to. So now we have a general idea what an angle is and how we denote it with symbols, it does not look like all angles look the same. Some are more open than others
And then that purple statement-- 1 in 5 of all students have a cellphone that is one year old or less. So 1/5 x have less than 1/5 year cell phone. ... So they want to know, out of the students who own a cell phone-- so it's out of this-- that's our denominator.
Now, adults seem to have a prevalently restrictive attitude towards kids, from every "Don't do that, don't do this" in the school handbook, to restrictions on school Internet use. As history points out, regimes become oppressive when they're fearful about keeping control. And although adults may not be quite at the level of totalitarian regimes, kids have no or very little say in making the rules, when really, the attitude should be reciprocal, meaning that the adult population should learn and take into account the wishes of the younger population.
And what's x plus 4 going to be equal to? Well, that's the largest of them. x is 75 plus 4 is going to be 79. And notice, we have three odd integers.
Minus 140. So I'm just subtracting 140 from both sides of this equation. If something equals something, something minus 140 is going to equal something minus 140.
I draw two perpendicular lines. Right? So this is going a quarter way around the circle.
Are you recording now?! well I'm here with Ellen And she was going to talk about how long she has been breaking for and what style she has been influenced by I have been probably been breaking for a year! and I look at videos tape online like japanese style or and Korean style and sometimes
2 times 6 is 12, plus 4 is 16. This is equal to 162 inches, which makes sense.
So the genome in an influenza A virus is very different than the genome in the influenza B virus.
In the early nineties if someone said, hey that's, you know, that's a googol, you wouldn't have thought of a search engine, you would have thought of the number 10 to the 100th power.
2 times 16 is 32. If you subtract, you get 8. And you could bring down another 0.
12 years ago, William was 7 times as old as Ben. So 12 years ago, this number is going to be 7 times this number. or another way to think about it is to take this number and multiply it by 7 and you're gonna get this number.
2/3 x times 3 is just 2x. y times 3 is 3y. And then 4 times 3 is 12. These are the same equations, I just multiplied every term by 3.
You really don't understand what you're doing and it really comes out of a little bit of algebra.
You can say 2 cups of flour over 3 cups of oatmeal is equal to ? cups of flour over 9 cups of oatmeal. I like the first way of doing it
So it all works out. So that's what we have right now. Now, we're going to add to girls to the classroom to change the ratio.
2 times negative 3 is negative 6. And now we can merge these two terms.
Find the slope of the line in the graph. And just as a bit of a review, slope is just telling us how steep a line is.
49, it's 7 squared, so it has 1, 7 and 49 as factors. This has 1-- it has a bunch of numbers, but it's not divisible by 7, so this is actually in simplest form, but this is an improper fraction. The numerator is larger than the denominator.
So our slope is equal to 3.
We fit 3 times 0 plus 7, that would be 7 and 7 is not less than 0. So it would violate this condition right over here, if you put a 0 over here. If you put a negative 15 over here, it should violate this condition, right over here.
15 to 25: If you divide both of these numbers by 5, you get 5 to 3. So based on this data, it looks like the ratio between the number of tomatoes and the number of servings is always constant.
Let's figure out what that is 2 times 5 is 10 2 times 7 is 14, plus 1 is 15 2 times 8 is 16, plus 1 is 17 2 times 1 is 2, plus 1 is 3 So, what's she's left over with is 3,750 mL
If I have 5 times 1, I'm going to get 5, because literally, all this is saying is 5 one time.
Mary made 15,000 mL of tea for a party and she served the tea divided equally in 8 pitchers Her guests drank 6 pitchers of tea How much tea did Mary have left over?
152 is going to be right to the right of that. So that's 152 right over here. So what are our two options?
Put a four there.
Negative 1 times minus 6m is plus 6m. Now you add the m terms.
5 miles times $2.50. $2, I'm gonna write it this way, times $2.50, $2.50 per, per mile. So the cab fare here is just going to be $2.50, $2.50, this $2.50 plus 5 times 2.50. Let's see, 5 times 2.50.
Let me take -4 - 2. So we're starting at a negative number and then we're subtracting from that. Now, if this seems confusing just remember the number line!
(Applause) (Music) When asked about deception, he said this:
Well, we can make the exact same idea.
Their goal was only 8 gallons. So did they meet their goal? Yes, they met their goal!
-8 times -8 is positive 64 You multiply that times negative 8 You get -512
We can multiply both sides of this by the diameter and we could say that the circumference is equal to pi times the diameter.
I'm still remembering the last problem.
When we divide both sides of this equation by negative 4, negative 5 divided by negative 4 is positive 5/4. So I shouldn't have had a negative there. I almost made a blunder.
So let's just take this each statement at a time. "y is directly proportional to x": that's literally just saying that y is equal to some constant times x
(Laughter) Ladies and gentlemen, I have devoted the past 25 years of my life to designing books.
Now lets bring down a zero 21 goes into 130, so lets see, would 6 work?
Simplify: negative one times this expression in brackets negative seven plus 2 times 3 plus 2 minus 5 in parentheses, squared.
The ability to hold something we've done or failed to do up against who we want to be is incredibly adaptive. It's uncomfortable, but it's adaptive.
So how many per minute? So if we divide revolutions by minutes, you're going to get let's see, 3 goes into 135... it looks like it would go into, let's see 3 goes into 100 twenty... forty times.
Let's think of all of the natural counting numbers that we can actually divide into 24 without having any remainder.
So you see that 4 goes into 7 one time, so you have one whole here, you have one whole ,and then how much do you have left over?
If someone told you that they ate 1/2 of a pie or if they told you that they ate 2/4 of a pie, it turns out of that they ate the same amount of pie. So that's why we're saying those two fractions are equivalent. Another way, if we actually had-- let's do another one.
Three times two is equal to six. We saw this in the multiplication video that the order doesn't matter.
(Applause) (Applause ends) You know, I never thought that I'd end up working at Microsoft.
But then we can shade in everything below 40. So everything that's just exactly below 40 is included in our solution set. So everything I've shaded in yellow is included in our solution set.
And what he did in "Elements" (especially the six volumes concerned with planar geometry),
As capillary networks do, they carry blood away from an area.
Innovation is the light of my wife, Noor. New inventions are the passion of my life.
We could look it up in the rest of the table because nine times three is the same thing as three times nine. It's twenty-seven.
Then I would have 1, 2-- so I have 1, 2, 3 equal sections.
In a language class, the girl to boy ratio is 5 to 8.
We say, b squared is equal to 24 squared minus 12 squared, which we know is 144, and that b is equal to the square root of 24 squared minus 12 squared. Now I'm tempted to use a calculator, and I'll give into the temptation. So let's do it.
The absolute value of negative 11, only 11 away from 0. So something that meets both of these constraints will satisfy the equation. And actually, we've solved it, because this is only a one-step equation there.
So if there's seventeen animals per group, fifty-one animals divided by seventeen animals per group.
0 × 27 is 0. Subtract. Then you have -
So we're starting at -3, the absolute value is -3[sic] is our starting point. To that we're adding another negative 7 We're going to move another 7 to the left.
I can't multiply 7 and 36 in my head, or I can't do it too easily. So let's see if we can simplify this first. Both our numerator and our denominator have numbers that are divisible by 4, so let's divide both the numerator and the denominator by 4.
What is the ratio of how much computers weighed in 1944 to how much a modern laptop weighs? Express your answer as a ratio of 2 integers. So the ratio of how much computers weighed in 1944, so we know that's 4500 kilograms, 4500 kilograms.
Well ten of something minus one of something is just going to be nine of that something. And then that is going to be equal to: What's seven point seven seven repeating, minus point seven seven, going on and on, forever repeating?
Maybe we'll start negative 2, negative 1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. Could keep going on. But the solution is x is equal to 3.
(boppy music) Let's get back to Darwin for a minute.
30 times 40 is the same thing as 3 times 4 with two zeroes, so let's do that. So you have 3 times 4 is 12, which we know, and then we have two zeroes. We got that zero, so let's stick that zero there, and then we got that blue zero there, so let's put that over there.
6 plus 3 is 9, so we have 9 ones. And then you go to the tens place and there's two ways to think about it.
5 times 1 is 5, plus 2 is 7.
Make a table for this and plot the function on a graph. Use your graph to determine how many Euros you would get if you give the office $50. I will write Euros is equal to-- so let's see, it's going to be dollars.
I do that by hovering over Perform Task, and by simply clicking on Start Now, and that brings me to the Review interface which is very similar to the translation interface, except for the white box that you have here to make notes about the review. But we will say more about reviewing a the translation you have requested ...
What I wanna do in this video is give an introduction to the language Or some of the characters that we use when we talk about geometry and I guess the best place to start is even think about what geometry means As you might recognize the first part of geometry right over here
2 times negative 3 is negative 6, minus 5 gives negative 11. The absolute value of negative 11 is 11, so we get 11 is equal to 11, so they BOTH work.
Well, to go from 1/2 to 2/4 we multiply the denominator-- the denominator just as review is the number on the bottom of the fraction. We multiply the denominator by 2. And when you multiply the denominator by 2, we also multiply the numerator by 2.
So 0 should not work, 0 should not work. It's not in the solution set, so let's try it out.
If he took 3 away, he'd have 2 left. But if he took 2 away, 5 minus 2 is indeed 3. And the third way, you'll learn this as we go into more of the how of algebra, and also the why, is that you could systematically solve it.
It's what Marianne LaFrance calls "standing in social quicksand." So this really spikes your cortisol. So this is the job interview we put them through, because we really wanted to see what happened.
The cube root of 7 to the third, well, that's just going to be 7. So this is just going to be 7. So our entire thing simplifies.
So it's a negative 6 minus 4.
Thrill Soda hired a marketing company to help them promote their brand against Yummy Cola. The company gathered the following data about consumers' preference of soda. So they have year-by-year, percentage over [UNKNOWN]
We have to be less than 7 and 1/2 away, so neither of those points are going to be included, positive 7 and 1/2 or negative 7 and 1/2. Now, everything in between is less than 7 and 1/2 away from 0, so everything else counts. Everything outside of it is clearly more than 7 and 1/2 away from 0.
So this 3 literally represents 3/10 while this 6 right over here represents 6/100.
This corresponds, so now we're looking at this angle right over here, angle ABC corresponds to angle
So if you divide 0.2 here and you divide by 0.2 here.
Notice, if we're including 1,500, we fill in the circle.
The left-hand side becomes 3x-- these cancel out-- is equal to 39 minus 26 is 13/3. And then we're going to want to divide both sides by 3. Or you can view it as multiplying both sides by 1/3.
So it's essentially a way of measuring how much space something takes up on kind of a two-dimensional surface.
So there's a couple of ways to think about it. You could literally view a 3 and 1/3 as this is the same thing as 1/5 times 3 plus 1/3. That's exactly what 3 and 1/3 is.
Let's see if we can write 0.0727 as a fraction. Now let's just think about what places these are in. This is in the tenths place...
So I have two pieces of pizza, and I'm going to divide them into thirds.
(Laughter) All across the globe, you have this tendency of men wanting a certificate. Because they want to leave the village and go to a city, looking for a job.
Let's compare 0.1 to 0.070.
So if we multiply 31 by 6, what do we get? You can even do this in your head.
What would 3 times 2/5 represent? 3 times 2/5. And I encourage you to pause this video and, based on what we just did here, think about what you think this would be equivalent to.
What number could replace this weird circle with an x symbol looking thing below? And over here, they have this equation.
So if you have 5 plus 5, that's 10, plus 8 is equal to 18. Now, let's verify that these two are the same exact thing. Up here, 5 plus 8 is 13.
So 5 times 3 is 15. And then to get from this 12 to this 48 right there, we had to multiply times 4.
It goes into 12 two times.
That means we have five groups of eleven students. five groups of eleven students.
Three over six plus two over six equals five over six. And subtraction is the same thing.
So you say, okay, 873- and I'm going to have 1,2,3,4 zeros behind it So 291 times 3 would give me 873 But I have to multiply- times 3 with 1,2,3,4 zeros to get this number 8.73 million
And five is less than or equal to twenty. Or negative sixteen is less than or equal to five, which is less than or equal to twenty. So that works, and that makes sense.
So one half plus one third is the same thing as three over six plus two over six. Notice I didn't do anything crazy. All I did is I re-write both of these fractions with different denominators.
literally I'm just saying if you divide the circumference by the diameter, you're going to get pi.
Our question asks us, what equation describes the growth pattern of this sequence of a block? So we want to figure out, if I know that x is equal to 10, how many blocks am I going to have?
I probably should have drawn it this big to begin with.
3 times 9 is 27. So this equals? Let's see, this equals--if we say that this 0 becomes a 10.
The absolute value of zero.
5 goes into 15 three times, so it goes exactly 343 times.
We have 2/8. The inverse of 2/8 is 1 over 2/8, which is the same thing-- this is equal to 1 times the inverse of this. Times 8/2, which is the same thing as 4.
And area 2 would also be 2.5. We know that because they're equal to each other, and when you add them up it's 5.
So our current ratio is four:seven.
It's not be multiplied by x.
The difference between 9 and 96 is going to be 87. And, of course, we're subtracting the larger from the smaller. So it's going to be negative 87 over 16z is equal to 2.
Bring down the six. seven goes into fifty-six eight times. eight times seven is fifty-six.
Multiple out 3 times 25. Now, is 25 divisible by-- you can give up on 2.
210 times t minus 5 times 210. Actually, let me just multiply it out so we save some space.
So if this is 5 or over we're going to round up if this is less than 5 we're going to round down. So let's bring another 0, lets bring another
The other thing you need to know about shame is it's absolutely organized by gender. If shame washes over me and washes over Chris, it's going to feel the same. Everyone sitting in here knows the warm wash of shame.
So any time you breathe in on Earth, this is what you're going to get. And we said in the last video that you have these capillaries, these pulmonary capillaries that are running all along the side of these alveoli. So let me draw those pulmonary capillaries-- and so when they are de-oxygenated-- so they come here to be oxygenated.
I just type CTRL+S, That's a shortcut to save this. and then I'll try to run this program. So there you go.
You can just keep counting to 8. In fact, let me just put our check box there. In general, you have your integers that contain both the positive and the negative numbers and 0, depending on whether you consider that positive or negative, or neither.
Point, or 0.7x, is equal to 12.60. And once you get used to these problems, you might just skip straight to this step right here. Where you say, seventy percent of the full price is equal to my sale price, right?
5 times 4 is 20. This 1/4 right here represents one piece plus one piece, so total we're going to have 21 pieces.
So looks like we got the right solution. It checks out.
This is peak fishing in a few seconds.
Well, 5 plus 5 is 10.
It is 75 over 68 and now we can just divide 75 by 68 and figure out what it is expressed as a decimal
Is 2a plus 2b equivalent to 2 times a plus 2b in parentheses? So when they're saying all of this thing over here, they're saying, hey, look, I'm just this irresponsible mathematician. And I like to just ignore parentheses without thinking about it fully.
So y is going to be 6 here. When x increases by 1 again, y is going to decrease by 2. So we're going to get to 4.
This is an ode to the mother goddess, that most of us in India learn when we are children.
So we would really have to round this up to, 8 is greater-than-or-equal to 5, so we round this up to 360 feet. So once again, whatever is... Just to make it clear, even this ambiguous, maybe we put a line over to show, that is our level of precision, that we have 2 significant digits.
So 18 is going to be equal to 2.25x. Now if we want to solve for x, we can divide both sides by 2.25, so let's do that. You divide 18 by 2.25, divide 2.25x by 2.25, and what do we get?
I said, "Cancer's only one page in my life, and I will not allow this page to impact the rest of my life." I also declared to the world at large that I would ride it out, and I would not allow cancer to ride me. But to go from where I was to where I wanted to be,
K that also sits on that segment and they tell us that JK is equal to 7x plus 9 So this distance right over here is equal to 7x plus 9. Then they tell us that JL is equal to a 114
5x minus 3x plus 2 is equal to 1. This looks very complicated. And whenever something looks daunting, just do steps that
The price of an MP3 player decreased by 20% from last year to this year. This year the price of the player is $120. What was the price last year?
And we said, listen, during the lean season, take the food out. You manage, the village manages these warehouses. And during harvest, put it back with interest, food interest.
So Yukon is equal to 298 times 20.
So you get 14y is equal to 6x minus 2. Then divide both sides of the equation by 14. You get y is equal to 6/14x minus 2/14.
"never good enough" -- and, if you can talk it out of that one,
So I'm going to multiply 2 times 3t plus 4g is equal to 2 times 6. Anything I do to one side, I have to do to the other side. The equality still holds true.
So what is 5 squared?
(Laughter) So I thought that saw dust must also have some kind of property because of which the oil gets [stuck] to it. So, once again the same experiment -
So this is going to be plus. We're going to be over 60. So all of these are going to be over 60.
2X plus 3 is equal to minus 15. I took a minus is there to make it a little bit tougher. So the first thing we wanna do whenever we do any linear equations , we want to get all of the variable terms on one hand side of the equation and all the constant terms on the other side
What's ten times one?
"Hey, you gave it a good shot. You did the best you could with the team that you had." So my hope is that when you leave TED, you will look at reducing your carbon footprint in however you can do it.
Fourteen objects. And I'm going to divide it into groups of five. Well, the easiest thing is there's one group right there, two groups right there.
So $259 and some change. So it might seem like a very subtle distinction, but it ends up being a very big difference. When I compounded it 10% for 10 years using compound interest, I owe $259.
So we get 6, so 3/4 is the same thing as 6/8. So we have 25/8, and we're adding 6/8 to that, that gives us 25 plus 6 is 31, over 8. So this number right over here is 31/8
And it makes sense. If you're going from feet to yards, the number should get smaller because yards is a bigger unit. You need fewer yards to go the same distance as a certain number of feet.
And we're going to get 45 divided by 9 is 5. So 45,000 divided by 9 is 5,000. So we're gonna get 5,000.
Then this tells us that the point when x is negative 1, f of x is equal to 2. This is just a fancy way of saying that both of these two points are on the line, nothing unusual. I think the point of this problem is to get you familiar with function notation, for you to not get intimidated if you see something like this.
You see how on the bottom two problems I had two different signs, positive 1 and negative 1? And the top two problems, this one right here both 1s are positive. And this one right here both 1s are negative.
And when I had 74, and I had to shift the decimal 1 more to the right, I had to throw in a 0 here. I'm multiplying it by 10. Another way to think about it is, I need 10 spaces between the leading digit and the decimal.
9 is the same thing as 3 squared.
Because now we didn't just increase by 1, we increased by 2. So now y is going to decrease by 4.
What I want to do in this video is think about how expressions are formed and the words we use to describe the different parts of an expression. And the reason why this is useful is when you hear other people refer to some expression and say, oh, I don't agree with the second term, or the third term has four factors, or why is the coefficient on that term 6, you'll know what they're talking about, and you can communicate in the same way.
J.T. loves burgers and loves to subscribes to a cell phone texting plan with three other members of his family. Within any given month, they cannot send more than 500 text messages total. So they cannot send more than 500 text messages total.
We're on problem 14. And it asks us what is the solution to the inequality x minus 5 is greater than 14?
We don't have to go above 11, because we already went through 12, and we know that there aren't any factors above that, because we were going in descending order, so we've really filled in all the gaps. You could try 11. We could try it by hand, if you like.
In 6 years, Arman is 24 and Diya is 8, Arman is 3 times as old as Diya And we are done!
Plus 2 is 74. And then we subtract.
This is the same thing as 10 + 5, is 15/100. And you could have done that a little bit quicker just by inspecting this. You would say, "Look!
"Hmm, that sounds nice, but it's Utopian." And I say, "Nope. I have proof."
So 100 tenths plus 1 tenth is going to be 101 tenths. I know it's really confusing. We have tens and tenths.
The last one, 15 to 60, you have to multiply by 4, so you have to do the same thing in the numerator.
The UK I know has some very strict firearms laws. You needn't bring the gun into the UK anymore.
2 times 5 is 10. Subtract. You get 2.
presents
Now there is nothing to say!
So, if we had a protractor over here, clearly this is opening up to 50 degrees, and this is going another 40 degrees, so if you wanted to say what the measure of angle DBC is, it would be, it would essentially be the the sum of 40 degrees and 50 degrees. And let me delete all this stuff right here, to keep things clean, So the measure of angle DBC would be equal to 90 degrees and we already know that 90 degrees is a special angle, this is a right angle, this is a right angle.
It says Nazrith is 4 years older than Omama.
So 7 divided by 7 is 1, so you just have 1x or you just have x is equal to 35 divided by 7. x is equal to 5.
Twenty times six is one hundred twenty. So that's twenty plus one hundred. So I'll put that one hundred up here.
So 20 hundredths plus 5 hundredths is 25 hundredths. Let's do a few more of these. These are a lot of fun.
(Video) Jinsop Lee: Hey, my name's Jinsop, and today, I'm going to show you what riding motorbikes is like from the point of view of the five senses.
And so every few weeks teachers could sit down and say, "OK, here's a little clip of something I thought I did well.
Here we find our fun friend Phillip riding around on a delightful day. Phillip just loves his Twitter. Ohhh, but there's a problem!
2 times the square root of 5. And once again, you could probably do that in your head with a little practice.
This time it worked out, cause this also has 2 significant figures, this also has two significant figures.
So, looking at our little atmosphere graph, you'll now think about it, knowing that we've got very little carbon dioxide and you know, about 21% oxygen. You could think of oxgyen kind of being, let's say something like that, well then, relative to that, nitrogen would be you know, much more, right? You have much more nitrogen hanging out.
And then what is minus 36 minus 5? That's minus 41. And now we want the x terms of the left-hand side.
2 + 7 is 9, 9 + 9 is 18, + 9 is 27, + 5 is 32, + 8 is 40, + 8 is 48 and 48 is divisible by three, but in case you're not sure, since this is equal to 48, in case you're not sure whether this is divisible by 3, you can just add these digits up again.
Let's start with a warm-up problem to avoid getting any mental cramps as we learn new things. So this is a problem that hopefully, if you understood what we did in the last video, you can kind of understand what we're about to do right now. And I'm going to escalate it even more.
6278 is clearly less than 7329, so we should be able to do this.
So all I did is I rewrote 7/4, or 7 one-fourths. I just kind of drew it for you. Now, what does this represent?
Well, your first reaction were, let's just add the 350 plus 8, you get 358. You'd get 358 feet. So this is the building plus the tower.
And then finally, on the sixth day, 6 days after Monday-- so what are we at, Sunday now-- we are going to have no inches on the ground. So that's that right there. And you can see that there's this line that formed, because this is a linear relationship.
So six times nine is fifty-four. All right, we're almost there. Seven times one, that's seven.
6 minus 0 is 6. And then we got our 13 just like that. So when I computed all this inside of the parentheses...
Use less than or greater than for this little brackets thing to write a true sentence. So they essentially want us to say whether 45.675 is greater than or less than 45.645. So let's look at each of these numbers.
You'd say look, two plus three is five. For every five students, two boys, three girls. How many groups are there?
I have three groups of seventeen animals. Now I want to know how many chickens. Every group has five chickens.
But then this last one, I only have four left, so I can't make another group of five. So the answer here is I can make two groups of five, and I'm going to have a remainder-- r for remainder-- of four. Two remainder four.
So this is 0, this is 1, this is negative 1, negative 2, negative 3, negative 4, negative 5, negative 6 and I could keep going. but were starting at negative 2, and then were subtracting 3 again, so once again we are going to move 3 to the left.
So we have one..two..three..four..five six..seven..eight..nine equal sections Did I count that right?
BA, BA with a line segment with a line over it would refer to that same line segment
This is an even number, 2 is going to didive into it. so lets see if thats what ya'll confirm in the hints.
Let's say this over here is 1,500. How would we display less than or equal to 1,500 a number line? Well, we would say, look, we could be 1,500, so we'll put a little solid circle right over there.
15 will go into 30.
Denis is vacationing in China and he wants to spend 30 dollars on a new sweater. The sweater he likes costs 197 Chinese yuan. One US dollar can be converted into 6 Chinese Juan.
Ken and Isaiah are eating pumpkin pie with their friends. They want to figure out how much pie they have eaten so far. There are 7 of them in total and each of them has eaten 2/5 of a pie.
So it is actually the fact that the LCM of 15, 6 and 10 is equal to 30. Now, this is one way to find the least common multiple. Literally, just find and look at the multiples of each of the numbers... and then see what the smallest multiple is they have in common.
Let's add some rational numbers. And I'm using that word because that's the word that this book uses, but in more popular terminology we'll be adding fractions.
This is going to be 10 to the 8 minus 12 minus 5 power. And then all of this on the left-hand side-- let me get a calculator out-- I have 1.45.
If y is 1 and z is 2, it's going to be 1 + 2.
Now, what if we wanted to represent something like this? I started off the video saying, science, you deal with very large and very small numbers.
When x is 2, y is 0. This right over here is the x-intercept.
So you have minus 55 over 3, that's just 5 times negative 11 over 3, that's a 3, minus 3.
Ten times one. Well that's just ten one time. Or one plus itself ten times.
So this is going to be divisible by nine.
Today, whole regions, like the Americas, are populated by people who can trace their ancestry back to multiple continents.
And let's say that this distance down here is 3 meters -- that distance is 3 meters. Let's say we don't know what that distance is and we don't know what that distance is.
Well, if you compare the 3,000 and the 4,000, you see you have an extra 1,000 over here. So let's add an extra 1,000 on the right.
So five goes into twenty-three four times. And what's left over is three.
The radius is constant as you go around the circle. So if this side is equal to this side, what do we know happens? It's an isosceles triangle, and the base angles are equivalent.
3 × 27 is 60 + 21, is 81. And then we subtract: 100 - 81.
The largest is 1 and seven 68ths, the next largest was this 1.081 which in its original form was 108.1 percent the next largest after that is the 0.5 and then we have the 0.357 which is the same thing as 35.7 percent and then finally the smallest value was the 13 over 93 now I did this, I went through all the work and I divide them all out
I have one more fourth there, so 4 times 5 plus 1 gives 21.
We got 113.931775701 - and actually it just keeps going - feet squared. And this is the final answer. We cared about how many tiles will fit onto this bathroom floor, now the significant figures come into play.
Square root of 20.
0, 0. I have two more 2's. I have a 3.
This is 11 and 7 tenths. So, clearly, this one is going to be greater. Both have 11, but this has 7 tenths as opposed to 5 tenths.
In fact we have in the stimulus bill -- it's interesting -- the House version actually had money in it for these data systems, and it was taken out in the Senate because there are people who are threatened by these things. But I -- I'm optimistic. I think people are beginning to recognize how important this is, and it really can make a difference for millions of lives, if we get it right.
And we say, if this is 5 or larger, we round up. And this is 5 or larger, so we're going to round up to 200. So this we're going to round.
If we go 12 into 95, I'm saying it goes seven times. So if that's true, if that's the largest number, then the remainder should be less than 12.
Well, what is X plus 2x? Well that's like saying I have one apple and now I have two apples. So here I have one X and now I have two more Xs that I'm adding together.
If y = 30 when x = 6, find the value of x when y = 45.
i think if you concentrate on watching dot papa you can't be that it is a warning is a great time and that therefore there is no i'm not quite acting on it
So let's think about what happens when we multiply by 10, and see if we can see some type of a pattern. So let's just start with 1 and multiply that 1 by 10.
We're told that in 40 years, Imran will be 11 times as old as he is right now. And then we're asked "How old is he right now?" Alright, so I encouraged you to try this on your own.
3 divided by 2 is equal to 3 times 1/2.
14,000, 800, and 97-- I already used the blue; maybe I should use yellow-- in expanded form. So let's think about what place each of these digits are in. This right here, the 7, is in the ones place.
So you would want this many oats. Now, let's think about what that is relative to a whole cup. Well, one way we can do it is to turn each of these four buckets, or these four pieces, or these four sections of a cup into eight sections of a cup.
I've used 3 toothpicks so far-- 4, 5, and 6. So that is my first townhouse. Now, let me make a little table here keeping track of things.
There's this pool of savings and let's say there's this other pool of entrepreneurs and they have a bunch of really good ideas for projects.
When someone says "You have your father's hair.", what they mean is "You appear to have inherited a gene or genes from your father that makes a protein that instructs your hair follicle cells to produce hair that curls like your father's", but they usually opt for the shorter version.
25 goes into 57 two times, right?
So 35 goes into 280 exactly eight times. 8 times 5, we already figured it out.
Or another way to think about it is, if I had two times three, I would get six. But because one of these two numbers is negative, then my product is going to be negative. So if I multiply, a negative times a positive,
Oh, yes, right there, 2 goes in, and you can do this on paper if you want, or you should but 2 goes into 42 21 times, so I can just try doing it 21 times, but we're not done yet, because 21 is not a prime number, is not even listed here, keep listing the prime numbers, 21 is not prime,and so 2 does not go into 21 anymore, so we're kinda done with 2, 2's, so actually, lets see, we have 1 2 over there, but 3 does go into 21!
This crazy Canadian named Powel Crosley commercialized this thing called the IcyBall in 1928, and it was a really neat idea, and I'll get to why it didn't work, but here's how it works. There's two spheres and they're separated in distance.
Minus negative 8. Minus of a negative is the same thing as a plus.
2-2 would be 0.
And 189 is clearly greater than 168. So 189/252 is clearly greater than 168/252. Or that's the same thing as saying 21/28, because that's what this is over here.
3 times 3 is 9. Let's subtract, get a 1, bring down the 0.
And we see that BC intersects AB at a 90-degree angle. This symbol right over here represents a 90-degree, or a right angle. So we just have to find side AB or BA.
We now have the general tools to really tackle any multiplication problems. So in this video I'm just going to do a ton of examples. So let's start off with-- and I'll start in yellow.
Evaluate 0 plus y plus -7 when y is equal to -3 and y is equal to 0 and y is equal to 7. So let's take the first situation where y is equal to -3...
The 3 [three] and 7 [seven] and 1 [one] ... these are numerical literals. In this particular case, they are integers. And you can..in this one over here, this is actually a String, which is a word you hear a lot in computer science. this is really..referring to a string...of characters. and in Python we can actually ask what are the types of these things.
And so negative 3 plus 2 is negative 1, or negative 1y is the same thing as negative y. So those simplify to this right over here. Now let's look at the xy terms.
So 7 times 10 to the fifth divided by 1 times 10 to the fourth. Well, this is the same thing as 7 over 1 times 10 to the fifth over 10 to the fourth, which is just going to be equal to-- well, 7 divided by 1 is 7.
Instead of writing "2 times 3"
Roughly 17 years! If you were to shoot a bullet straight at the Sun, it would take 17 years to get there! If it could maintain it's velocity somehow
When I raise something to the fifth power, that's just like saying 2 to the tenth times 2 to the tenth times 2 to the tenth times 2 to the tenth times 2 to the tenth, right? All I did is I took 2 to the tenth and I multiplied it by itself five times. That's the fifth power.
So the multiplicative inverse of that-- one of the harder words for me to say-- is just going to be equal to-- so that's the inverse-- is going to be 1 over this, which is just going to be negative. The denominator becomes the numerator. 2y to the third over z cubed.
What is two to the ninth times four to the one hundredth? Actually, maybe I shouldn't teach this to you. You'll have to wait until I teach you the next rule.
And then you say, well, sixteen does go into 138, but how many times does it go into 138? And you might try nine first, and I'll do all my arithmetic on the right side so you ight say 16 times 9, 6 times 9 is 54, 1 times 9 is nine, plus five is fourteen, so that's a hundred and forty-four times, but still, that's larger than a 138.
9 squared is 81, plus 7 squared is 49.
We saw in the last video that when you multiply or you divide numbers, or (I guess I should say when you multiply or divide measurements) your result can only have as many significant digits as the thing with the smallest significant digits you ended up multiplying and dividing. So just as a quick example, if I have 2.00 times (I don't know) 3.5 my answer over here can only have 2 significant digits
10 to the third is 1,000. So we know that 10 to the third is equal to 1,000. So essentially the largest power of 10 that I can fit into this.
8 goes into 40 exactly five times.
Eighteen is just ten plus eight. So it's eight, then we put a ten up here. And ignore all this up here.
And we can write these as mixte numbers. if it's easier to visualize. 13 over 3 is four and 1 thirds. So this y-intercept right over here. this y-intercept right over here.
You've got a one there, so it's one hundred and ninety-two. Right? Yeah. one hundred and ninety-two.
Only 21% is oxygen. What happens to all that nitrogen there? How come that doesn't go into our blood?
(Laughter) A place where most men would love to be.
Well we have one, two, three, four shaded in. So now we have a total of 4/9 shaded it. 4 of the 9 equal sections are shaded in.
3 times negative 4y is negative 12y. And then 3 times negative 25 over 3 is just negative 25. Now, we want to get all of our constant terms on one side of the inequality and all of our variable terms-- the only variable here is y on the other side-- the y is already sitting here, so let's just get this 25 on the other side of the inequality.
So you have that purple line and the other one that's another line. That's blue or something like that.
And 29 is a prime number, so it's not going to share any common factors other than 1 with 12. So we also have this in the most simplified form.
So the absolute value of 9 minus 7. And then what's the next smallest? We have this 3, and then a 5 and a 10.
Write the prime factorization of 75. Write your answer using exponential notation. So we have a couple of interesting things here.
I sometimes forget what I just said. Maybe I'm aging. Problem number two.
Well, negative 1 times negative 1 is 1. And I think you see a pattern forming. Let's take negative 1 to the third power.
(Laughter) It is a bit of jaggery, a bit of urens and a bit of other things I don't know. But it actually doesn't leak.
So just the process when you add fractions is if they already-- well, first of all, if they're not mixed numbers, and neither of these are, and if they have the same denominator. In this example, the denominators are already the same. The denominator is 15.
So we just did a fairly simple example where you lent money for me for a year at 10% percent, right? So let's say that someone were to say that my interest rate that they charge-- or the interest rate they charge to other people-- is-- well 10% is a good number-- 10% per year.
Now we just solve the equation.
And then one times zero is zero. one times four is four. And you get six zero zero. Then you count the decimal spots. one, two.
In this situation, the GCD of 105 and 30 is 3 &amp;times; 5 = 15 So you can do it either way. You can just list out the traditional divisors or factors until you figure out which of those is common and is the greatest
This, taking away an X and a Y is the same thing if you distribute the negative sign as taking away an X and taking away a Y. And so on the left hand side, we're left with just 2X and we have taken away one of the X's, we're left just an X.
I'll do it out here just so it's not part of any of these numbers, and then 1 plus 1 is 2. And then we have to remember the decimal sitting right over there. So the exact distance she ran was 22.55 miles.
First problem: what is fifteen percent of forty? The way I do percent problems is I just convert the percentage to a decimal and then I multiply it times the number that I'm trying to get the percentage of. So 15% as a decimal is 0.15.
60% of the Serbian army dies.
Negative 11 plus x plus 11, negative 11 plus 11, they're going to cancel out, right?
10 and 6. It's equal to 26. Then we bring down another 0.
Negative 1 times 3 is negative 3. And then let's go to our parentheses here. We have 3 minus negative 1, that's the same thing as 3 plus plus 1.
(Laughter) Men are restless, men are ambitious, men are compulsively mobile, and they all want a certificate.
What happened if I did negative one times zero? Now this might seem, this doesn't fit into any of these circumstances, zero is neither positive nor negative. And here you just have to remember anything times zero is going to be zero.
And so 26 doesn't have any perfect squares in it. It's not like we can factor it out as a factor of some other numbers and some perfect squares like we did here.
So let me now make a distinction between simple interest and compound interest.
(Laughter) Success story.
This would be 50 degrees if they were parallel, but this and this would have to be supplementary; they would have to add up to 180 degrees. Actually, regardless of whether the lines are parallel, if I just take any line and I have something intersecting, if this angle is 50 and whatever this angle would be, they would have to add up to 180 degrees. But we see right here that this will not add up to 180 degrees.
Things that people think, "It can't be done differently, that's how it's done." I came across a great quote recently from Abraham Lincoln, who I thought you'd be pleased to have quoted at this point.
- and just to be clear: brackets and parentheses are really the same thing Sometimes people will write brackets around a lot of parentheses just to make it a little bit easier to read, but they are really just the same thing as parentheses. So these brackets are here,
What's 15 times 26? Well, let's multiply it out.
So one, two, three, four, five, six. And I'm going to divide it by three. And one way that we can think about that is that means I want to divide my six bell peppers into three equal groups of bell peppers.
And so you're left with negative 2y is equal to 15 minus 5x. And now, let's divide everything by negative 2. If you divide everything by negative 2, what do we get?
7 to the left of 7 which was 7 to the right of 0! This gets us back to 0. So the answer is... zero.
If you really want to do it properly should be P-E and then multiplication and division are at the same level and addition and subtraction are at the same level What this tells us is that we do parenthesis first and expeonentiation takes priority over everything else here, so we have to evaluate these exponents before we multiply anything or before we subtract anything. So the one exponent we have to evaluate is three squared so just remember three to the first is three, it's just three times itself once so it's just 3.
Reading the newspaper -- it never has to be outdated. (Laughter) You can get video annotations of the events that you're reading about.
We get six divided by three is equal to two, and six divided by two is equal to three. And the reason why you see this relation where you can kind of swap this two and this three is because two times three is equal to six. Let's say I have two groups of three.
Let's do another problem.
And now I speed up through the 1920s and the 1930s. And, in spite of the Great Depression, western countries forge on towards greater wealth and health. Japan and some others try to follow but most countries stay down here.
So notice, we have 2 times 2, times 2, times 2. So this is 2 to the fourth power. So it's 16 times 49.
5 times 8 is 40. Subtract. No remainder.
The long molecules of DNA, containing your genes, are organized into pieces called chromosomes.
To go from 1/10 to 1/1,000, you have to decrease in size by 100. So we could just say 422 decigrams times 100 milligrams per decigram. And then the decigrams will cancel out, and I'll get 422
And then finally, I have this positive three, this plus three right over here. Now I'm just going to re-arrange this addition. So I'm just going to take all the terms and multiplying by nine hundred ninety nine.
If you want to destroy them then close all the windows and doors, become a grave so nothing can escape outside you -- but you will be a dead man, with all your treasures also dead with you; your truth, your freedom, your love,your joy. Everything will be dead with you -- securely dead, well-insured.
So that means that y is equal to some constant, we'll just call that k, times x. This is what it means to vary directly. If x goes up, y will go up.
Well, what's 6 to the sixth power? That's 6 times itself six times. So, it's 6 times 6 times 6 times 6 times 6.
So this is an order of operations problem, and remember in order of operations, you always wanna do parentheses first. Parentheses. Parentheses..first.
Negative 3 power, negative, negative 3 power. So at first, this might be daunting. Do the negatives cancel?
43 tens is 430.
One plane goes in that direction at 400 miles per hour.
If I say that AB is equal to five units It might be centimeters or meters whatever I just the abstract unit is five,
On Judy's way home from school yesterday, she ran for half the distance. Then she skipped for 1/4 of the remaining distance and walked the rest of the way home.
But the word is really beautiful.
So 0.25 times P is the amount of tax he's going to pay on this diamond pony. Now, they say Handsome Jack's total bill for the diamond pony. Well, he's going to pay P for the pony plus 0.25P in taxes.
1998: A single mother of four, three months after the birth of my fourth child, I went to do a job as a research assistant.
If I have 6 times something equal to 18, if we divide the two sides the equacao by 6, do I solve the equacao then divide the left by 6, and divide the so I figur by law 6 and we then y equals 3 and you can try This and ' and ' cool about a equacao
Actually let me write it first like 4 plus 4 times 99 Do the same thing over here This is the same thing as plus 9-- do that magenta color- plus 9 plus 9 times 9
Well we already know that 1 times 10 times 10 is 100, and then we're going to multiply that times 10 again. So we're going to literally have 10 100s which we know is the exact same thing as 1,000. So what's the pattern here?
3 to the third power is equal to 27. So every time we decrease by a power, we're dividing by 3.
