So in this case n was 4. n is our sample size.
This is equal to x to the third.
That's all I have.
But it's not easy.
That's what it's learning. Okay?
(Laughter) And it might happen the opposite, the other way around.
Now we can multiply both sides of this equation by negative 1, just to make it a little bit cleaner, so that becomes a plus and a plus.
So, that's a very tiny tiny amount of time, really.
So these electrons in here are going to pick up this proton, which would cause these electrons to move in to reform our aromatic ring, and to take away the plus 1 formal charge.
