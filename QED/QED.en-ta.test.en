So it looks like, every term, you subtract 6. So the second term is going to be 6 less than the first term. The third term is going to be 12 from the first term, or negative 6 subtracted twice.
So 584 times 1,000 is equal to what? Well, it's going to be 584 with three zeroes behind it, or you could view it as 584 times the 1, and then you're going to have three zeroes in the final answer. So it's going to be 584,000.
21 divided by 7. Which is 3. And just to really hit the point home, I could have done this problem-- Instead of multiplying by 1 over 21--
So we get 0.7 goes into 12.60. Let's multiply both of these numbers by ten, which is what we do when we move both of their decimals one to the right.
Let me draw a big fat arrow to signify this is 15 15 has an absolute value of 15. So the length of this arrow would be 15. Now, we are adding -46 to that 15, that is the same thing...
Charles bought 5 apples that cost $0.47 each. He paid with a five-dollar bill.
Based on the examples in the last video let's see if we can come up with some rules of thumb for figuring out how many significant figures, or how many significant digits, there are in a number - or a measurement. So the first thing that is pretty obvious is that any non-zero digit, and any of the zero digits in between are significant.
(Laughter) And she said, "I saw your talk live-streamed. It was not really you.
Looks like we always have one plus a certain number of columns of four, but how many columns do we have? When x is equal to 1, we have no columns of four blocks. When x is equal to 2, we have one column.
So negative 4 times 7 is negative 28.
1, 1 group of 4, 2 groups of 4, 3 groups...3 groups of four. So now we could view 12 as being 3 groups of 4. Or we could say, we could say that 3... (let me get the right tool out) ...we can say that 3, 3 times 4... ...3 times 4 is equal to 12.
"I just need some strategies."
It's a different shade of green. You are just left with the 3x. The 5 and the negative 5 canceled out.
(Laughter) Everybody in house loved it, and so off it goes to the author. And even back then,
NBC -- I'll show all of the networks here -- the top journalists for NBC asked 956 questions in 2007 of the presidential candidates: two of them were about the climate crisis.
And that's sometimes the quick way to do it.
And let's say we know that the measure of angle ABC is equal to 50 degrees. Right, so there's a bunch of interesting things happening over here, the first interesting thing that you might realize is that both of these angles share a side, if you view these as rays, they could be lines, line segments or rays, but if you view them as rays, then they both share the ray BA, and when you have two angles
Let's see. Let me make the pen thin again, and go back to the orange color, OK.
For the solution set is everything less than or equal, so we can-- it could be equal to 32, or less than. So we fill in everything below that. Remember, the reason why we're filling in this solid, the reason why 32 is an acceptable solution to this original inequality, is because of this less than or equal sign.
60 minus 56 is 4. And now, we can bring down another 0 right over here.
[Ben] no, no. gotta get them all. [Sal] And I belive that's all there is
It represents 4 thousands, which is the same thing as 4 times 1,000, which is the same thing as 4,000. 4,000 is the same thing as 4 thousands. Add it up.
If I were to ask you what 1/3 to the negative 2 power is-- well, this is going to be equal to 1 over 1/3 to the second power. You get rid of the negative and you inverse it. So this is going to be equal to 1 over-- what's 1/3 times 1/3?
So let's say 40 times 0.15. five times zero is zero. five times four is twenty.
8 plus 5 is 13.
So by definition it's going to have 1 and itself and something else, so it's going to be composite.
The square root of 2 is just the square root of 2.
So now this is the same thing as 641 - 8. Well 41 - 8 is going to be 33. I have to do a little bit of mental computation here.
You wouldn't be able to see what I drew here, but if we had 48 of them, it would get us about that much of them, so that would be the 48 out of the 64. So this whole blue area is 64.
As the cube root of 8 times 8 times 8 And so this is equal to this is equal to -1 Or I'll just put a negitave sign here
Rewrite the expression below applying the commutative and associative properties of addition, and then show that both expressions yield the same result. So, one, we could just evaluate the expression the way that it is written, then we could mess around with it using the commutative and associative properties of addition. So lets first add 17.5 plus 3 so that's going to give us 20.5, so this is going to be 20.5.
And the rest of the problem was 2 plus this thing, which is 77, minus this thing. And here, since everything is in addition or subtraction, let's just go left to right.
Now take the product of negative 8 and that expression and then add 6.So let's do it step by step.
Our 8 represents-- we see it's in the hundreds place. It represents 8 hundreds. 8 hundreds
Mario started the day with 5 fire flowers. He used some and now only has 3 left. If u is the number of flowers he's used, we can write the following equation.
6 × 2 is 12, + 4 is 16.
This actually also works for three but we'll think about that in a future video.
(Laughter)
(Laughter)
That's 4 x 22! So this is divisible by 4.
How do you get from ten:five to two:one? Well you can think of what's the biggest number that divides into both of these numbers? What's their greatest common divisor?
So, the easy way to convert 2.7 to an integer is to move the decimal place one to the right, or another way of thinking about it is to multiply it by 10. So, we could multiply this by 10 but that would, if we just multiply the denominator by 10, that would change the value of the ratio. In order to not change the value, we have to multiply the numerator and the denominator by 10.
4 times m is 4m plus 4 times 7 is 28. And then we could do it two ways. Let's do it this way first.
It's going to be 13 into 9 we are going to put some decimal places right over here, 13 doesn't go into 9, 13 does go into 90 and it goes into 90 as let's see it does go into 7 times It goes into it 6 times.
5 to the first power is just going to be equal to 5.
So let me add those up: so if you take 1.901 and add that to 2.09, you get 1 plus nothing is 1, 0 plus 9 is 9, 9 plus 0 is 9, you get the decimal point, 1 plus 2 is 3.
As we go from two times one, to two times two, to two times three, what's happening? How much are we going up by?
Three plus five is equal to eight.
2/1 is the same thing as 2. And to do that, I'll do a little side-- fairly simple-- example, but hopefully, it gets the point across. Let me take four objects.
Notice this, to go from 2 to the 0 to 2 to the 1, we multiplied by 2. I'll use a little x for the multiplication symbol now, a little cross. And then to go from 2 to the first power to 2 to the second power, we multiply by 2 and multiply by 2 again.
So the 5 or the negative 2 in this case you could just so Oh I can just add the coefficient and that's ok. There's nothing wrong with that but I really want to emphasize there's a very common sense intuition here
I can click on the task relating to the translation made by Axel, and note that this is a difference from the dotSUB system where you were not able to see who had made the translation. I think this is a very useful feature of Amara, I really like it. So, I'm going to request the task of reviewing Axel's translation,
This one, let's see, we have a negative 9 being multiplied by negative 4x plus 9, and then we are adding 4. So all you have to do to go from this expression to this expression, instead of adding the 4 there, you just add the 4 here, and then these two are identical expressions. So we will go with this one right over here.
We're told that the formula for converting a Celsius temperature into Fahrenheit is the Celsius temperature, or C, is equal to 5/9 times the Fahrenheit temperature minus 32. Rewrite the formula so it solves for Fahrenheit.
0.0000000008192. Clearly this is a super cumbersome number, right? And you know you might forget about a 0, or add too many 0's, which could be costly, if you're doing some important scientific research, or maybe doing, or you wouldn't prescribe medicine in this small a dose, or maybe you would, I don't want to get into that.
11, it's only divisible by 1 and 11, so 11 is then a prime number. And we could keep going on like this. People have written computer programs looking for the highest prime and all of that.
10,000 times 10 is 100,000. So this is going to be 100,000. Now, you might have noticed, every time we multiply it by 10, we're adding another 0 to the product.
Now I took this diagram, and I put it in a Photostat machine, (Laughter) and I took a piece of tracing paper, and I taped it over the Photostat with a piece of Scotch tape -- stop me if I'm going too fast -- (Laughter) -- and then I took a Rapidograph pen -- explain it to the youngsters -- (Laughter) and I just started to reconstitute the dinosaur. I had no idea what I was doing, I had no idea where I was going, but at some point, I stopped -- when to keep going would seem like I was going too far.
25 goes into 57 two times.
So it might look something like that. So the area is going to be 36 times 20 square inches. 36 times 2 is 72.
We don't teach American history in Britain. (Laughter) We suppress it.
3xy divided by 3y, you just have an x. And then if you divide minus 6y squared by 3y, minus six divided by 3 is minus 2, y squared divided by y is y. Let's see, if we assume that x does not equal 2y, because then this would be undefined, we can cancel these two out.
60 minus 56 is 4. So we still have a remainder, so let's keep bringing down some zeroes. So let's bring this 0 down here.
-1.2 (I'll do it in this blue color) ,
And notice, not less than or equal to.
And then whatever's left over will be the remaining numerator over 5.
My technology.
"Two months in the marriage?"
like we haven't had answering machines for 45 years! (Laughter) I'm not bitter.
So, this is and then if we look at 6.71 squared, we're only 2.400ths above 45, so this right here is closer to the square root of 45. So if we approximate, to the hundreths place, definitely want to go with 6.7.
(Laughter) Because the chimpanzee would score half right if I gave them two bananas with Sri Lanka and Turkey. They would be right half of the cases.
Same thing with the X's, you actually don't have enough information. Y depends on what X is,and X depends on what Y is. Lucky for us however,we do have some more of these blocks laying around.
Then she uses up 5. She gets a net of 7.
So, I'm just, I started off with 10.4, and I'll write meters in blue, meters in blue, and seconds, seconds in magenta. Now, we wanna get the kilometers per hour, I know our meters per second. So let's take baby steps.
If I were to ask you what 3 to the second power is, or 3 squared, this is equal to 3 times itself two times. This is equal to 3 times 3. Which is equal to 9.
The ratio of girls to total students is 5 to 13. One way of thinking about it is if you were to evenly divide the students into groups of 13, every group of 13 students would have 5 girls. Now, I think we're ready to figure out how many total girls there are.
And I actually want to think about what happens when x is negative 1, when x is 0.
2x minus 5 is equal negative 11 - let's add 5 to both sides of this equiation. On the left hand side we just get 2x because the 5's cancel out.
What I want to do in this video is really make some clarification that goes a litle bit more in detail about the different layers of the Earth. So let me draw a cross-section of the Earth over here. I won't be able to do it perfectly to the scale, but I will try to do a little bit better job and giving you a little bit of the sense of how thick these layers are.
A zoo has 15 Emperor Penguins who make up 30% of the total number of penguins at the zoo. How many penguins live at the zoo? So let's let x equal the total number of penguins who live at the zoo.
We get 6x minus 14y is equal to 2 right? I just multiplied every term on both sides by 2. And now let's add the left sides together.
Pay 4,000 bucks and come to TED. (Laughter) Or failing that, do the eight things -- and trust me, these are the big eight things that lead to success.
Ladies and gentlemen, gather around. I would love to share with you a story. Once upon a time in 19th century Germany, there was the book.
The 50-ounce solution had 12.5 ounces of saline.
If you take one over a and divide by a, you get one over a squared. And you could just keep doing this pattern all the way to the left, and you would get a to the minus b is equal to one over a to the b. Hopefully, that gave you a little intuition as to why-- well, first of all, you know, the big mystery is, you know, something to the zeroth power, why does that equal one?
And 90, if we were to round down, we would go to 1,500, and we would round down to 80. So these are our two choices. Now we've seen the last two examples.
(Music) For this delight and for this wonder, people rejoiced.
So six divided by two is three. Or you could think of it the other way. You could say that six divided by two is-- you're taking six objects: one, two, three, four, five, six.
7 times 6 is 42.
So 27 times 13. 3 times 7 is 21, carry the 2, 3 times 2 is 6 plus 2 is 8. Let's put the 0 down here.
And we want to go half of the way to 3/4.
Well, actually, I only have ten seconds before YouTube won't let me upload it. So we'll have to stop there.
These guys cancel out and we're left with n= 10 * 36 is 360/8. And notice we're getting the exact same value that we got with cross multiplying. And with cross multiplying, you're actually doing 2 steps.
Well, 11 times 3 is 33, and then we have two zeroes here. So this will be 3,300. So it's a little bit smaller than that.
Well, that's just going to be 7/8 x? So this relationship is the exact same as this one over here. The price after the discount is 7/8 of the original price.
And that equals sevenx plus seven. So now it's turned into a, I think this is a level three linear equation. And now all we do is, we say well let's get all the x's on one side of the equation.
So 30/45 is the same thing as 2/3. It's equivalent to 2/3.
We, once again, have 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6/5.
And let's say that the height of this triangle is 4 centimeters. And I were to ask you what is the area of the triangle?
So, when Ragav experienced that he went from "teacher told me," to "I am doing it." And that's the "I Can" mindshift.
Well now you've learned what I think is quite possibly one of the most useful concepts in life, and you might already be familiar with it, but if you're not this will hopefully keep you from one day filing for bankruptcy. So anyway, I will talk about interest, and then simple versus compound interest. So what's interest?
Fair enough. So they wrote 2y squared, and they're saying that x is equal to 1, which is irrelevant because there is no x here, and y is equal to 5. So if y is equal to 5, this thing becomes the same thing as 2 times 5 squared.
"The Compendious book on Calculation by Completion and Balancing." And it was written by a Persian mathematician who lived in Baghdad, in, in...
1 times 5 is 5. 3 times 3 is 9. Let's do one more.
When we were first exposed to multiplication and division, we saw that they had an inverse relationship. Or another way of thinking about it is that they can undo each other.
So we divide both sides by positive 5 and we are left with just from this constraint that x is less than 15 over 5, which is 3.
Here we've constructed a vector. We took its vertical component and its horizontal component and we're able to figure out the total vectors This projectile in this situation, its total placement--just to make it clear
Write the equation of a line that has a slope of one-third, and contains the point negative 12, negative 14-thirds. So the equation of a line we can write as 'y' is equal to... ...'mx' plus 'b'. This is in slope-intercept form, where 'm' is our slope, and 'b' right over here is our y-intercept.
Subtract We get a 6
We've learned a little bit about gravity. We've learned a little bit about electrostatic. So, time to learn about a new fundamental force of the universe.
has been condemned so much
And you see that here, when x went from 0 to 5, y went from 0 to 2.
You can divide the 12 by 3 and get a 4.
I have given the slide show that I gave here two years ago about 2,000 times. I'm giving a short slide show this morning that I'm giving for the very first time, so -- well it's -- I don't want or need to raise the bar, I'm actually trying to lower the bar.
In order to request a review, you'll start, as always, from the general TED Amara page.
5000 over 27 divided by 9 is 3. And I think we have now simplified this about as much as we can.
21 times some number is equal to 3. Well, what happens if we multiply both sides by 1 over 21? By the inverse of the coefficient.
So we say, in 4 years. x plus 4. And that's just -- so, in 4 years. So we could translate that into x plus 4.
Let's do some problems that involve subtracting fractions, or instead of saying fractions, we could say rational numbers, either way. I'll do every other of these up here. Let's start with b.
So the largest number that is, I guess you could say, a factor of both 20 and 40 is actually 20 20 = 20 &amp;times; 1, and 40 = 20 &amp;times; 2 So in this situation, we don't even have to break out our paper, we can just write 20 Let's do a couple more of these
Well 9 times 0 is 0, plus 7 is 7...is 7. And then finally, finally, we have (and once again I'm looking for a suitable color) 9 times 8, 9 times 8, this is the last thing we have to compute.
Let's see if that satisfies it.
You get, in this case, x is greater than-- you don't have to swap the inequality, because we're dividing by a positive number-- negative 58 over 2 is negative 29, or, here, if you divide both sides by 2, or, x is less than negative 34. 68 divided by 2 is 34. And so, on the number line, the solution set to that equation will look like this.
And that's 100. 100 is divisible by both 100 and 10. So let's get this 10 to be a 100.
So seven to the one hundredth power times seven to the fiftieth power-- and notice this is an example now-- It would be very hard without a computer to figure out what seven to the one hundredth power is. And likewise, very hard without a computer to figure out what seven to the fiftieth power is.
There's no sugar in Drink B. It is 0% sugar.
In the ordinary economics if you give something, you will have less.
1 minute is equal to 60 seconds. By definition, a second is 1/60 of a minute. But what about 5 minutes?
Multiply 6 times 1/4. Simplify your answer and write it as a mixed number.
If we take the prime factorization of 12, 12 is 2 times 6, 6 is 2 times 3, so 12 is equal to 2 times 2 times 3. That's the prime factorization of 12.
So 0.79, this is the same thing as 79/100, so I'll just write it that way. So this is the same thing as 79 over 100. Then of course, we have minus 4/3.
(Laughter) A uniform, she said, and asked for my measurements. My measurements.
7 times 7 is 49. Subtract. You have a remainder, so it does not divide evenly.
6 goes into 5 36. I don't know if if I gave myself enough space.
So if we have decigrams cancel out, 422 decigrams will equal-- that divided by 10 is equal to 42.2 grams. And now we can just go from grams to milligrams. Well, that's an easy one.
We've already seen that fractions could be used to represent parts of wholes. Now we're going to extend that idea a little bit to think about them as actual numbers on the number line.
I'll use G for the height of the giraffe. The height of the giraffe is 3 times taller-- not 3 more feet-- 3 times taller than Shantanu's height. So we could say that the giraffe's height is equal to 3 times Shantanu's height.
So that worked, 13 is less than 21. And you could just subtract, I did it in my head right there, but you could re-group, you could say that this is a 10 and then this would be a 5 10 minus 7 is 3.
- You want to make sure you have your decimals lined up - 3.257 257 257 . . . keeps going on forever. Notice when we multiply it by 1,000 it allowed us to line up the 257's so that when we subtract, the repeating part cancels out. So let's do that subtraction.
One times 12 is 12. If you subtract you get a remainder of, well we could actually regroup here, or borrow, if you don't want to do this in your head, you would get nine, but let's do this. So if we borrow one from the two, the two becomes a one, this becomes 11, or we're really regrouping a 10.
"In the course of my law reading, I constantly came upon the word 'demonstrate'. I thought at first that I understood its meaning, but soon became satisfied that I did not. I said to myself, what do I do when I demonstrate more than when I reason or prove?
1 person weighs 160 pounds, so there's one person for every 160 pounds. So notice, if we multiply these two expressions, the pounds will cancel out. We'll be just left with people.
We can rewrite this as y is equal to 0x minus 4, where the y-intercept is negative 4 and the slope is 0. So if you move an arbitrary amount in the x direction, the y is not going to change, it's just going to stay at negative 4. Let me do a little bit neater. y is just going to stay at negative 4.
If I just said thirty (30) divided by five (5), I'd get a positive six (6). And because I have a negative divided by a negative, the negatives cancel out, so my answer will still be positive six (6)! And I could even write a positive (+) out there, I don't have to, but this is a positive six (6).
The distance from this thing to 0 has to be less than 2 and 1/2, so we can write that 2r minus 3 and 1/4 has to be less than 2 and 1/2 and 2r minus 3 and 1/4 has to be greater than negative 2 and 1/2. Same exact reasoning here. Let me draw a line so we don't get confused.
And then you get-- let's see, if I take 4,400 divided by 220-- 440 divided by 220 is 2. So this is going to be 20. So 4,400 divided by 220 is just 20.
75, you subtract. 78 minus 75 five is 3.
So, for example, let's say that this length right over here is 1/6 of the circle's circumference. So it's 1/6 of the way around the circle. Then this angle right over here is going to be 1/6 of 360 degrees.
Compulsive gamblers are experts at self-deception.
So, twelve times twenty-eight -- let's see.
We now know we could divide atoms and actually if you do you may create a nuclear explosion. But it's the same idea behind prime numbers. In theory, no prime number is not a theory.
We want to figure out how many cups there are in 3 and 1/2 gallons.
6, bring it down. It's not being added to anything. You get 68.
And I do believe, that my soul would have no rainbow if my eyes had no tears. Thank you for listening.
And I think you have a sense of what two and one half is.
Now to isolate the z we can just divide both sides of this inequality by negative 3 but remember when you divide or multiply both sides of an inequality by a negative number, you have to swap the inequality. So we can write negative 3z We're going to divide by negative 3 and then you go 18 divide by negative 3 but we're going to swap the inequality!
18. This is 74. 0.
Well, 1 over 21 times 21 is just 1, so we get s is equal to 3 over 21. And 3 over 21 is the same thing as 1 over 7. And we can verify that.
3 times 3 is 9, and times 2 is 18. And were done. we have not been able to prove the fundamental theoem of arithmatic wrong! Ben:
82 minus 75 is just a 7, right?
Now,, he adds 1.2 liters of Drink B. He finds that bees prefer this new solution, Drink C. So when you add these two together, you end up with Drink C.
25 times 15. And actually, we could do that in our head. This is 26 times 15, so 25 times 15 is going to be this minus 15.
Since the end of the last Ice Age, farming societies have been absorbing their neighbors, making populations more similar within continents.
Equation B. When our delta x is equal to-- let me write it this way, delta x.
Or I also know that 0.6666 going on forever is the same thing as two / three. So it's sixty-six and two / three. But since we're working with money and we're working with dollars, we should just round to the nearest penny.
5 is just 5, because it is a prime number. So the least common multiple of 8 and 5 has to have a 5 and three 2's in it. Or another way of saying it, it has to be 5 times 2 times 2 times 2, which is the same thing as 5 times 8.
You could add the exponents, so that's equal to 1 over 3 minus 7 is x to the negative 4. And then this-- if we just get rid of the inverse, we take the inverse of it, we can put a negative in front of this negative, making it a positive-- this is going to be equal to x to the 4. So no matter how we did it, as long as we're consistent with the rules, we got x to the fourth.
So you could also view it as negative sixteen has to be less than or equal to three x plus five, and three x plus five needs to be less than or equal to twenty. This statement and this statement are equivalent. This one may seem a little bit more familiar because we can independently solve each of these inequalities and just remember the AND.
So the total number of texts that everyone sent cannot be more than 500. So if we take the sum of J.T.'s texts, plus his older sister's texts, plus his younger sister's texts, plus his mother's texts, they all have to be less than or equal to 500 total texts. Right, it can't be more than 500, so the sum has to be less than or equal to 500.
Well, that's the same thing as 1.25P. So that's the same thing as this right over here. So it's 1.25P.
These are people who worked this project for two to three years. And they are so excited. That's the first board off the line.
81 is 9 times 9. You could factor more if we were trying to do the fourth root or something like that, but we want to just do a square root. We have a 9 and a 9, so no need to factor any more.
Suppose you have 1/3 of a gallon of water that gets frozen. What is the volume of the ice that you now have?
So that's, I'm just, I'm just gonna take this and substitute it back into the original equation. And you might wanna try that out, too.
5 hundreds - 0 hundred is 5 hundreds (500), represented as a 5 in the 100s place.
JL: And that's how the five senses graph works. Now, for a period of three years, I gathered data, not just me but also some of my friends, and I used to teach in university, so I forced my --
3 goes into 10 three times.
20 goes into 100 5 times.
left-hand side when I substitute a negative 1 there. So the left-hand side becomes negative 9, minus 9 times negative 1 is negative 9, minus 6.
So 4/5 is 0.8. You've got the 1 there.
Let's see if we can write 0.36 as a fraction. The way I like to do it is to say, well, 0.36, this is the same thing as 36 hundredths.
Change in x is equal to 5. What was our corresponding change in y?
9 hours is 540 minutes. Or another way you could think about it is, well, if each hour is 60, 9 times 60 is 540.
One, two, three, four, five, six. And here, instead of dividing it into three groups like we did here.
7 times something divided by 7, that's just going to be that something. That's just going to end up with an x. But if I do it on the left-hand side of the equation, I have to do it on the right-hand side of the equation.
And these two adjacent angles make up a 90 degree angle so they must add up to 90 degrees. So the two angles, angle FAC, and angle CAH are complementary because the measures of these two angles must add up to 180 degrees, oh sorry... must add up to this 90 degrees, right over here.
0 times 8 is 0. You subtract.
And I'm thinking to myself, "Brené, what are you doing? Why did you bring this up?
So, when I started Riverside school 10 years ago it became a lab, a lab to prototype and refine a design process that could consciously infect the mind with the "I Can" bug. And I uncovered that if learning is embedded in real-world context, that if you blur the boundaries between school and life, then children go through a journey of "aware," where they can see the change, "enable," be changed, and then "empower," lead the change.
Well, when all of the electrons are doing random different things in a metal bar, then it's not magnetized. Because the magnetic spins, or the magnetism created by the electrons are all canceling each other out, because it's random. But if you align the spins of the electrons, and if you align their rotations, then you will have a magnetically charged bar.
Let's see if we can write 59.2 percent (59.2 %) as a decimal.
4 times 3 is 12 and 32 plus 12 is equal to 44. That is also equal to 44, so you can get it either way. But when they want us to use the distributive law, you'd distribute the 4 first.
5 minus 3 is 2 And then you have 90 minus 87 is 3 I'm doing the subtraction a little fast just so we can get the general idea
7 times 1 is 7, plus 3 is 10. So we get 7 times 146 is 1,022. Now we're going to deal with this 2.
So we get p is equal to, distribute the 3, 3 times p is 3p minus 3 times 6 is 18. Now we can subtract 3p from both sides of the equation. We get minus 2p, right? p minus 3p is minus, or negative, 2p is equal to negative 18.
1 times 12 is equal to 12. We have 1 entire group of 12, 1 times 12 is equal to 12. And we could think of it the other way around.
So let's let R be equal to the number of apples at River Orchards. So this first sentence, they say-- let me do this in a different color-- they say for the past few years, Old Maple Farms has grown about 1,000 more apples than their chief rival in the region, River Orchards.
Well, our corresponding change in y when our change in x was 5, our change in y was equal to 2.
5 squared plus 3 to the fifth. Or 3 to the fifth and then that whole thing squared. So let's just work this out.
What would happen if I had zero (0) divided by negative five (-5). Well this is zero negative fifths
Simplify the rate of cans of soda compared to people. So this ratio here says that we have 92 cans of soda for every 28 people. What we want to do is simplify this, and really just putting this ratio, or this fraction, in simplest form.
If I grow by twenty-five percent and then I shrink by twenty-five percent I'll end up with the same amount of money. But I'll show you it's actually not that simple because the twenty-five percent in either case or in both cases is actually a different amount of money. So let's figure this out.
We have 18 parts. Now 8/18 is equal to one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. That's 8/18.
(Applause) That's him pressing my buttons back there, which he does all the time.
It's actually strange that 873 showed up over there My brain is doing strange things in the back ground But anyway that has actually no relevance to the actual solution of this problem
So I have a circle here, that's my circle. And it has a triangle inside the circle.
And they already tell us that when x is negative 2, y is 8.
Divide by 1/4 is the same thing as multiplying by 4/1.
6 times 0.25 is-- or actually, this is now a 25. We've shifted the decimal. This decimal is sitting right over there.
So if I were to rewrite it, we get 2r minus 3 and 1/4 is the same thing as 3 times 4 is 12, plus 1 is 13.
Let's do problem 6. I'll do that right here. So you have 4 times c.
And to figure it out, we just look at the digit one place to the right of the 3, so we look at the 2 right there. If that digit is 5 or greater, you round up. So this is 5.
5 × 20 = 100. And we are done. So this, written as a decimal, is 0.65.
1 shows up seven times. Just like that.
That's a good word for a spelling bee.
In this video, I want to tackle some inequalities that involve multiplying and dividing by positive and negative numbers, and you'll see that it's a little bit more tricky than just the adding and subtracting numbers that we saw in the last video. I also want to introduce you to some other types of notations for describing the solution set of an inequality. So let's do a couple of examples.
If you lined up all the DNA containing all of your genes, it would measure 6 feet long, but it's coiled, so tightly that it fits in just one cell nucleus.
And really, all they're doing to get to this point is they are simultaneously multiplying both sides of the equation by both denominators. Let me show you what I mean. If I multiply both sides of this equation by 6 and an x, what's going to happen?
Well, 54 divided by 6 is 9. And since both terms, the divisor and the dividend, are both negative -- negative 54 and negative 6 -- it turns out that the answer is positive. Remember, same signs result in a positive sign.
So, eleven times zero. This is easy, this is zero!
Now I'm going to show you the world 200 years ago, in 1810.
But he was hanging out right there in around the 8th or 9th century. So let me draw a little timeline here, just so we can appreciate everything. So that is... timeline.
8 goes into 0 zero times, 0 times 8-- you get the idea. 0 times 8 is 0. We have no remainder.
Because the more hemoglobin you have, the more oxygen you can take up. And I can do a ton of videos on hemoglobin and all of that-- and actually, I'm going to do a lot more on the circulatory system so don't worry about that, but I want to go over one other really interesting thing about hemoglobin. We already talked about red blood cells.
20 minus 7y is equal to 6y minus 6. So, what I really wanna just do is isolate all of the y's on one side of this equation, and then if there's some coefficient in front of it, I can divide both sides by that coefficient. And I could isolate the y on either the
And if just out of curiosity you want to know what that number is, we can solve it. So if we do 243 times 243. 3 times 3 is 9.
5x minus 3x is 2x.
And I like this point because this is nice and easy to graph. So we see that the point 0, 0 and the point 5 comma 2 should be on this graph.
Let's think about whether 8 works.
So they have 12 times 3 in parentheses, and then they multiply that times 10. Now whenever something is in parentheses, that means do that first. So this literally says let's do the 12 times 3 first.
30 minus 25, well, that's just 5. I mean, we can do all this borrowing business, or regrouping. This can become a 10.
5 times 2 is 10 minus 3, which is, indeed, equal to 7. So this is definitely a solution. Let's try the other one out. x is equal to negative 5.
Welcome to the presentation on level one exponent rules. Let's get started with some problems. So if I were to ask you what two-- that's a little fatter than I wanted it to be, but let's keep it fat so it doesn't look strange-- two to the third times -- and dot is another way of saying times-- if I were to ask you what two to the third times two to the fifth is, how would you figure that out?
And so another way of viewing this, eleven over twenty-five, this is the same thing as eleven divided by twenty-five, so we can literally say, we can literally divide 25 into 11 and whatever we get that is going to be the decimal representation of 11/25. And, since we're going to go into the places less than the ones place we're gonna go into the tenths place and the hundredths place and the thousandths place, let's add some zeroes to this eleven right over here after the decimal and now let's start to divide.
1 plus 7 is 8.
So the common denominator of 3 and 4, or the least common multiple of 3 and 4, the smallest number that's divisible by both of them, that's 12. So let me write it this way.
You also know that 0.05 and 5/100 are the same thing. So let's get back to the problem. I hope that distraction didn't distract you too much.
So that is 4. And then 5 days after Monday, we have 2 inches on the ground.
This is going to be 1 times 10, which is 10, and then that 10 times 10. So it's literally 10 10s or 100. Now let's multiply by 10 again.
So if someone where to ask you a question, they say "Hey, I have the number 217 and I want to multiply it by something, and I want to get one after multiplying it by that something"
8 divided by 4 is 2. 4 divided by 4 is 1. So that equals 7/2.
Then they tell us when x is 1, y is 2.
5 times 8 is 40, and you're left with no remainder, so it goes evenly. So 120-- let me get rid of that.
If I were to tell you, what, what is 10 to the 0 power? We know that's equal to 1.
I think A is our prime contender. Choice D, 64.
Evaluate 1x when x is equal to -1,0,and 1. So let's do the scenario x is equal to 1. So 1x becomes 1 times.. one-which is now negative 1
If you take the absolute value of negative 30, it's going to be greater than 21. Likewise, up here, anything greater than positive 21 will also have an absolute value greater than 21. So what we could say is 7x needs to be equal to one of these numbers, or 7x needs to be equal to one of these numbers out here.
It's so right there in the media. Its a quick picture of where students are at where they are having issues where the struggles are. I know who I need to visit with and where I can help them and where I can come along side and media and support.
And then if you go quarter way around the circle, that's 90 degrees. All right? Hopefully you're getting a bit of an intuition for what an angle is.
And 4 and 3 don't share any prime factors with each other. So their least common multiple is really just going to be the product of the two.
8 times 4 is 32.
So how would I represent 1/2 here? Well, if I take one of these wholes and I put it into two sections right over here, 1/2 would be this section right over there.
117 is 13 times 9. It's the product of a perfect square and 13. 26 isn't, so we've simplified this about as much as we can.
You can just keep going below 40. It just keeps going on in both directions. And any x that is less than 40 will satisfy this.
"and we've got a trial plan." The trial plan, if you just want to try things out, you can come to any of the sessions and it's going to cost you $12 per 1hr session. but if you like what you're doing here you might want to get a monthly membership That'll be $20/month, that you can view that as the basic plan
25 times 2 is 50.
If for each change in x--so over here x is always changing by 1, so since x is always changing by 1, the change in y's have to always be the same. If they're not, then we're dealing with a non-linear function. We can actually show that plotting out.
So 4 times 201. So as we've seen in previous videos I'd like to write the larger number on top. This is just one of many ways of tackling a calculation like this.
So our change in y in this circumstance is equal to 2.
2, 1, Booster Ignition... and a final lift off of discovery. As a social media manager at Nasa Headquarters in Washington D.C. I oversee all of NASA's social media accounts, and uh, primarily the @nasa Twitter account and make sure that we are engaging with our followers on Twitter.
And that equals seven times x plus one. And that's the same thing as x plus two. And, remember, it's seven times the whole thing, x plus one.
So we're going to start with a 1, and then we're going to multiply it by negative 1 one time-- times negative 1. And this is, of course, going to be equal to negative 1. Now let's take negative 1, and let's take it to the second power.
So this is the first of a series of videos in which we show you how to build a "beetle bot" without using any solder. This is our Khan Academy "Spout" beetle bot. So it's got LED eyes, and a bunch of different ways you can make it.
You Have Not Known Total Chaos -- Just Wait... About the Non-Serious Approach to Meditation and the "So-Called Spiritual Search" As I write this question my hands are shaking.
1, 2, 3. Let's check our answer. Let's do a couple more of these.
YouTube, they're putting this thing on YouTube.
Lets see if we can express 16 over 21 as an decimal Or we can call this sixteen twenty first. This is also sixteen divided by 21.
You could have something like: x + y + z = 5. Now - this expression is equal to this other expression. 5 is really just an expression right over here.
And that's the only one there, so minus 3. And we've simplified it as far as we can go. We are done.
What is the cost of 14.6 gallons of gasoline at $2.70 per gallon? So we have 14.6 gallons, and each gallon's going to cost $2.70. Or we can even view $2.70 as 2.7 dollars.
(Let me write that down.) 7 times 3 is equal to 21. You could do this part in your head but I just want to make it clear where I'm getting these numbers from. What I would do in the standard method is I would write the 1 in the 21 down here but then carry the 2 to the tens place.
Instead of having 1 plus 99, you'd had 1 plus 999, 1 plus 9999, etc So the only thing you have to really worry about is this part right over here you have to ask yourself in order for this whole thing to be divisible by 3 this part is- well that part is, then this part in order for the whole thing has to be divisible by 3 that also has to be divisible by 3 But what is this right over here?
Let's now think about different ways to represent a mixed number. And let's say that our mixed number is 2 and 1/8. Actually, let's make it a little bit more interesting.
You divide eighteen by six.
If you have 7 of something you add another 3 of something, you have 10 of something now let's look at the Z if I've got 8 of something and I take away one of them I'm going to have 7 of that something that is 7z and you might say hey what was the coefficient here on the -Z Well implicitly I could have put a one here.
Negative 1 to the first power is negative 1. Then you multiply it by negative 1, you're going to get positive 1. Then you multiply it by negative 1 again to get negative 1.
What is 27 to the negative 1/3 power? Well, don't get too worried. We're just going to take it step by step.
In here, 10 to the minus 3, you only have two 0's, but you have three places behind the decimal point. So what is the largest power of 10 that goes into this? Well how many decimal, places behind the decimal point do I have?
So x is, x = 9 when y=45.
Well, 1 times 10 is 10.
To write literally the 6 followed by the 23 digits, or the 6 0 2 2 followed by the twenty 0's there. And to answer that question, and in case you're curious, Avogadro's number, if you had twelve grams of carbon, especially twelve grams of carbon-12, this is how many atoms you would have in that.
So just like that, we were able to figure out the rate of change between these two points. Or another way of thinking about it is, this is the average rate of change for the curve between x equals x one and x is equal to x two. This is the average rate of change of y with respect to x over this interval.
2 plus 9 is 11, plus 8 is 19. 1 plus 4 is 5. So you get 59,049 which is clearly way bigger than 268.
We already know that 2 to the fourth power can be viewed as starting with a one and then multiplying it by two four times. So let me do that. So times 2 times 2 times 2 times 2, and that will give us, let's see, 2 times 2 is 4, 8, 16.
I learned it when I was four at my mother's knee.
You could say 12 divided by 4 is 3, so 120 divided by 4 is 30. So we have two more factors: 4 and 30.
Then you have 3 hours, which is 180 minutes.
-3 +2 gets us there. And if we start there and we subtract 2 we should get back to -3. And we see that happens.
Now, 16 goes into 4 zero times.
Well, 4 times 1, we know, is equal to 4. So we put a 4 right over there in the ones place. Then we could multiply our four times the digit that we have in the tens place.
Where's the can opener? It's in the second drawer from the right. No no no no the other one.
This has 2 significant digits, this has 3.
Negative 48 plus 1 is negative 47. So our answer is negative 47 over 3. Problem 3d.
In this video, I want to talk about Schwann cells. Schwann cells are glia of the peripheral nervous system derived from neural crest cells and named after a person who described them. Schwann cells come in a couple of shapes.
Until then, Cancer was the zodiac sign of my friend, stage was what I performed on, and grades were what I got in school.
I want to make this one a whole, because I want to get to 2, so let me put in a 1/8 there.
And 99 is divisible by 3
So in our first term, we had one block. And then our second term-- I'll just write this down, just so we have it --what happened here? So it looks just like our first term, but we added a column here of four blocks.
So I looked back up and she said, "Are you really going to try to break in and steal the video before they put it on YouTube?" (Laughter)
Once again, let's let x equal the number that three is nine percent of. You didn't have to write all that.
If w is going to be larger than 150, let's say it's 151, then this difference is going to be 1 millimeter, we were over by 1 millimeter. If w is less than 150, it's going to be a negative number. If, say, w was 149, 149 minus 150 is going to be negative 1.
10 to the 1 has 1 0.
60 is also a common multiple, but it is a bigger one. This is the least common multiple. So this is 30.
0 will work.
This evaluates to 9. -7 is exactly 7 to the left of 0. So the absolute value of -7 is +7.
Just based on, 0.7 it's about two thirds, it looks like about the same. And actually we could calculate this right here if we want, actually let's do that just for fun.
And if you wanted to compare them directly, you could multiply 3/10 times-- well, both the numerator and the denominator by 10 so you're not changing its value. 10/10 is essentially 1, or it is 1. So this becomes 30/300.
So if we look at the number line, it's more than 24,200 and it's less than 24,300. And it's 259, so if this distance right here is 100, 59 is right about there, so that is where our number is.
So it only has 1 and itself. A composite number is a natural number that has more than just 1 and itself as factors and we'll see examples of that.
I often like putting that as an improper fraction, but 1/2 is pretty easy to deal with, so let's add 19 and 1/2 to both sides of this inequality. Did I just say equation? It's an inequality, not an equation, it's an inequality sign, not an equal sign.
And either way you think about it, that's how you would get the least common multiple or the common denominator for 4 and 3. Well, to get from 4 to 12, you've got to multiply by 3. So we're multiplying the denominator by 3 to get to 12.
(Laughter) And slowly over time, I started putting myself in a better mood.
So let's see which of these are integers.
So minus 1/2 times minus 1/6 that is positive 1/12 and then plus 3/4. That is the same thing as 1/12 plus 9/12. 1 plus 9 is 10 over 12.
So let's say that the sperm cell that went on to fertilize my wife's egg, let's say it happened to have that one, that one, or I could just pick one from each of these 23 sets. And you say, well, how many combinations are there? Well, for every set, I could pick one of the two homologous chromosomes, and I'm going to do that 23 times.
The industrial revolution makes countries in Europe and elsewhere move away from the rest, but the colonized countries in Asia and Africa, they are stuck down there. And eventually, the Western countries get healthier and healthier. And now, we slow down to show the impact of the First World War and the Spanish flu epidemic.
It is, first of all, profoundly unequal: half the world's people still living on less than two dollars a day; a billion people with no access to clean water; two and a half billion no access to sanitation; a billion going to bed hungry every night; one in four deaths every year from AlDS, TB, malaria and the variety of infections associated with dirty water -- 80 percent of them under five years of age. Even in wealthy countries it is common now to see inequality growing.
So if the Earth was a big magnet, you would actually view that as a south pole of the magnet. And the geographic south pole is the north pole of the magnet. You could read more about that on Wikipedia, I know it's a
C. 5/11 divided by 6/7. Once again, this is the same thing as 5/11 times the inverse of 6/7, so times 7/6.
17 minus 9 is 8. Bring down a 0.
highest score I could get on an exam is 100, what is the highest average I can finish in the class if I were to really study hard and get 100 on the next 2 exams? Well, once again, what we'll want to do is assume we get 100 on the next 2 exams and then take the average. So we'll have to solve all 6 exams.
"It's the first time I can see my husband's face in winter."
2 times 4 is 8. You subtract. 10 minus 8 is 2.
I have the answer to a question that we've all asked. The question is, Why is it that the letter X represents the unknown?
10 to the third, you're going to have 7,400. And then 10 to the fourth, you're going to have 74,000. Notice, I just took this decimal and went 1, 2, 3, 4 spaces.
So if you divide both sides by negative 5, you get a negative 14 over negative 5, and you have an x on the right-hand side, if you divide that by negative 5, and this swaps from a less than sign to a greater than sign. The negatives cancel out, so you get 14/5 is greater than x, or x is less than 14/5, which is-- what is this?
E. This looks interesting. We have a negative out in front, and then we have a 6z minus 2 over 3.
And then on 3 days after Monday, we have 6 inches on the ground. You can see that a line is forming here. And then if we go to 4 days after Monday, we have 4 inches on the ground.
Take 3, plug it into that equation.
Well, 7 plus 5 is 12.
3 times 2 is 6, so our new numerator is 6. 5 times 1 is 5.
These two things are equivalent. This is as an improper fraction. This is as a mixed number or a mixed fraction.
And actually, H1-N1 and H3-N2 are the subtypes that we see in humans today. So the combinations of proteins that we see in these viruses is very important because this is what the immune system sees when a virus enters the body. It sees what's on the outside of the virus.
4 times-- now what's c equal to? They tell us c is equal to 5.
And then I have a minus 25 out over here.
And, of course, we still have this 3 out there. So 2 and 1/4 plus 1 and 5/8 is the same thing as this right here, and this is equal to-- we have our 3 plus, and then over 8 we add the 2 plus 5. We have 7/8.
But then, I was exposed to the most extraordinary knowledge and skills that very poor people have, which are never brought into the mainstream -- which is never identified, respected, applied on a large scale. And I thought I'd start a Barefoot College -- college only for the poor.
You know, five million four hundred ninety-three thousand six hundred ninety-two times zero. What does that equal? That equals zero.
So we want both of them to be over 12. And this fraction already is over 12 so we don't have to change it: 91/12.
And that's another word here so a point is just literally A or B But A and B are also the end points of these line segments Coz it starts and ends at A and B
-1 + 14 = 13 So 13 =13, so it satisfy the first equation. Now lets us look at the second equation.
The nine is in the hundreds place so we can literally re-write it as 9 x 100.
We would literally just multiply this times 4. So four of the twenty will need to be made pink.
And by 100,000 years ago, their skeletons weren't so different from ours. But these early homo sapiens shared the planet with two of their distant cousins. By this time, as a result of previous migrations,
In 1987, I was a new mother with my first child and was holding her and feeding her when an image very similar to this came on the television. And this was yet another famine in Ethiopia. One two years earlier had killed more than a million people.
2 minus 2 is nothing. But anyway, 30 minus 25 is 5. Now we can bring down this 7.
So 3/5 divided by 1/2 as an improper fraction is 6/5. Now, they want us to write it as at mixed number. So we divide the 5 into the 6, figure out how many times it goes.
5 plus 2 is 7. 7 plus 7 is 14, plus 9 is 23. 2 plus 3 is 5, plus 9 is 14, 17, 21.
Well, it's clearly still extremely popular.
In this video we're going to look at the definitions of acids and bases
Remember, we could draw 7 rows, right, and each of them is going to have 4 square centimeters -- each of those is a square centimeter.
So we're all familiar with a magnet.
2 times 1 is 2. So once again, we get 5/2.
1 times 10 is 10 liters. Now, if we wanted to convert this to centiliters, we're going to want the liters in the denominator, and you want the centiliters in the numerator. Now, how many centiliters are there per liter?
152 is a little bit closer to 200.
And you have many other countries trying to see and to rediscover that feeling of, "How do we imagine a future which is magnificent and peaceful and tolerant?" I want to tell you something, that the Internet and connectivity has created [a] new mindset. But this mindset has continued to be faithful to the soil and to the land that it emerged from.
We get I is equal to p-2w over 2. Or if we wanted to write it the other way we could write I is equal to p-2w over 2, and we are done.
These two guys will cancel out, and you're going to get 2x is equal to 1 plus 2, is equal to 3. And now you can divide both sides by 2, and you get x is equal to 3/2. And I'll leave it for you to verify that this is indeed the correct answer.
So six times five is thirty. And I'm gonna subtract, to go from five to forty-five have to multiply by nine, so have to multiply the numerator right nine if I don't wanna change the values.
I did also an unethical study of the professors of the Karolinska Institute, that hands out the Nobel Prize in Medicine, and they are on par with the chimpanzee there.
0.2% is the same thing as 0.002. This can always trip you up and I've made this careless mistake all the time, so don't feel bad if you ever do it. But just always pay careful attention if you see a decimal and a percentage at the same time.
The answer is No as it satisfies the first equation, but not the second.
Everything less than 10/3 is in our solution set. And let's draw that. Let's draw the solution set.
Let's imagine negative 2 plus 3. And I encourage you to pause this video and try to think about this on your own. We draw the number line again.
So we're not going to be able to, this is not a legitimate, this right over here is not a legitimate of table. Table three.
If x is equal to 40 degrees, what is the value of y? And you'll be like, how do I figure this out? I know the angles of a triangle add up to 180, and all that, but they've only given me one angle, and I don't know the angle.
1 times 5 is 5. Subtract. You have a remainder of 1.
To be selfish simply means to be yourself.
Let's say the super small change right there, that is our dr, and it's made up of-- it's our dx, our change in x is that right there. You can imagine it's that right there times-- but we're vectorizing it by multiplying it by the unit vector in the horizontal direction. Plus dy times the unit vector in the vertical direction.
29, if we round to the nearest ten, 9 in the ones place is greater than or equal to 5, so we round up. The nearest ten is 30. And another way to think about it.
If I said 3 to the 7, and all of that to the negative 9, once again, all I do is I multiply the 7 and the negative 9, and I get 3 to the minus 63. So, you see, it works just as easily with negative numbers. So now, I'm going to teach you one final exponent property.
Brother! Please Come hear. How is the electricity bill of our next door is so much reduced
So 21 of something... If I have 21 of something and I take 8 of them away, I'm left with 13 of that something.
You will never be as young as you are right now. And that's why I believe that if you live your life with a great attitude, choosing to move forward and move on whenever life deals you a blow, living with a sense of awareness of the world around you, embracing your inner three year-old and seeing the tiny joys that make life so sweet and being authentic to yourself, being you and being cool with that,
13 is a prime number. We can't factor this any more.
Your body is made up of 50 trillion cells, cells come in many different varieties, with different functions, but inside, almost of every cell is a nucleus, containing 99.9% of your genes, and mitochondria, containing a few more genes.
So what is the least common multiple of 2 and 12, or what's the smallest number that's divisible by both of them?
Let's do the multiples of 6:
was he started with basic assumptions. And those basic assumptions in "geometric speak" are called "axioms" or "postulates". And from them he proved, he deduced other statements or "propositions" (these are sometimes called "theorems").
'-12 + 84 = 72' Now if I want to solve for B, I just have to divide the whole equation by 3. And so I am left with 'B' is equal to, drum roll, '72/3'
They won't stand out, they won't be ridiculed, but they will be part of the in-crowd if they hurry. (Laughter) So, over the next minute, you'll see all of those that prefer to stick with the crowd because eventually they would be ridiculed for not joining in.
So negative 10 works. Now let's just verify things that shouldn't work.
We already know that an angle is formed when two rays share a common endpoint. So, for example, let's say that this is one ray right over here, and then this is one another ray right over here, and then they would form an angle.
So our first term we saw is 15. Our second term is 9. Our third term is 3.
Round up to 424,000 or round down to 423,000.
So it's going to be 5,960 meters. And we are done. Let's do one more of these word problems.
And this has a pretty low viscosity, especially in relativ to the mantle, so that is why people kind of consider this in a more traditionally liquid state. But as you get deeper and deeper and deeper, the pressure becomes so huge as you get to the inner core, remember all of the weight of all of the rock above you, of these thousands of miles of rock above you, is all pushing down on the rock below it. So the inner core even that the temperature is really really hot, the pressure is so big that them molecules cannot flow past each other, they cannot be liquid, they are kind of jam-packed.
60 already looks interesting, because it is a common multiple of both 15 and 60. Although we have to of them over here. We have 30 and we have a 30, we have a 60 and a 60.
There's 1, 2, 3...actually I'll use another color.
And so this leads to the paradox that because the disease is only in the poorer countries, it doesn't get much investment. For example, there's more money put into baldness drugs than are put into malaria. Now, baldness, it's a terrible thing.
And three times 0 is less than 18 so it meets both constraints. If we put 4 here, it should only meet one of the constraints.
I now want to solve some inequalities that also have absolute values in them. And if there's any topic in algebra that probably confuses people the most, it's this.
What do we have to multiple the denominator by to equal 180? You can divide 4 into 180 (180/4 = x) to figure that out.
Let's see... 1 plus 5 is equal to 6, plus 3 is equal to 9. We have to remind ourselves: this is nine hundred. This is in the hundreds place.
So she goes like this.
With no money to fund my studies, I scaled new heights. Now, they call me the local Spiderman.
8 times 8 is 64. And then you subtract. 70 minus 64 is 6.
This is a problem. It impacts:
So negative 4 times 3 is a negative 12.
"What was the benefit you had from solar electricity?" And she thought for a minute and said,
When people use the word "perimeter" in everyday language they're talking about the boundary of some area. And when we're talking about perimeter in math, we're talking about a related idea but now we're not only talking about the boundary, we're actually talking about the length of the boudary, how far do you have to go round the boundary to essentially go completely around a figure, completely go round the area. So let's look at this first triangle right over here.
-5 times 6 is 30.
So 1/3 is the same thing as 100/300.
So 10 to the negative 1-- if I multiply by 10 to the negative 1, that's the same thing as dividing by 10. And so I'm moving the decimal over to the left one. Here I'm multiplying by 10 to the negative 8.
It literally represents 4,000.
And so, you could view this as being 1 over 2 times, so 2 times 2 times 2 times 2, if you just view 2 to the fourth as taking four 2s and multiplying them, or if you use this idea right over here, you could view it as starting with a 1, and multiplying it by 2 four times. Either way, you are going to get 1 over, 1 over 16.
Negative sixteen is less than or equal to thirty-five, but thirty-five is not less than or equal to twenty. And that's why ten is not part of our solution set.
So there I've represented this mixed number, 2 and 1/4. Let's see how we can decompose this. So let's get our grids back.
(Music) Saidullah Sahib: I couldn't wait for the boat.
And so I have 201 times 4. Now just like we did when we were multiplying a one digit times a two digit, we do essentially the same process. We first multiply 4 times the 1.
Well, the intuition here, if I'm going 10.4 meters per second, how many, how many kilometers is 10.4 meters? Well, kilometers is a much larger unit of measurement, it's 1000 times larger. So, 10.4 meters will be a much smaller number of kilometers.
So we say 8 goes into 7 zero times.
This number up here is not divisible by 2, it's not divisible by 5.
Let's keep going with our 2008 Calculus BC free answer questions. So we're on problem number 2. And I cut and pasted the table that they gave for the problem.
So we have 21 pieces, where each piece is 1/4, so we could say we have 21 times 1/4 or 21 fourths pieces of pie. However you want to think of it, but we've solved the problem. We're at an improper fraction.
Now in the last video where I talk about animals colonizing the land first they weren't animals that only existed on land. They were animals that probably spent most of their time in the ocean collecting food or whatever and they would show up on land to lay eggs. And if you think about it, back then the land would have been a really good place to lay eggs because there wouldn't have been much else on the land.
Well what's the least common multiple of two and three? Well that's the smallest number that's a multiple of both two and three.
50 meters times-- how many-- so what's the relationship between meters and centimeters?
Let's see 4 times 93 would be 372, so it actually goes into it only three times.
Let's imagine what would happen if we had negative 2 minus 3. So this was positive 2 minus 3, now let's think about negative 2 minus 3. So once again, lets draw our number line and I will put 0 over here.
One plus five is going to be equal to six.
We're talking a 900-page book that is as weird as it is compelling, and featuring a climactic scene in which a horde of tiny people emerge from the mouth of a sleeping girl and cause a German Shepherd to explode.
We'll it goes into zero times 0 times 7 in the end is 0. So yo subtract and you have no remeinder . So we could keep going and will just keep getting zeroes like this.
0 shows up four times. Draw it just like that.
(Laughter) I loved to write from the age of four, and when I was six, my mom bought me my own laptop equipped with Microsoft Word. Thank you, Bill Gates, and thank you, Ma.
Or you could say there's forty students. twenty-four of them are girls. forty minus twenty-four is sixteen. So either way you get to sixteen boys. And if you want to pick up a fast way to do it.
Line C Let's do the y-intercept first. You see immediately the y-intercept-- when x is equal to 0, y is negative 2. So b is equal to negative 2.
Negative 1 the fourth power?
Well, we just saw that 2/5 would be the same thing as-- so let me just rewrite this as instead of 3 times 2/5 written like this, let me write 2/5 like that-- so this is the same thing as 3 times 2 times 1/5.
One of the weird things that's happened is, after the TED explosion, I got a lot of offers to speak all over the country -- everyone from schools and parent meetings to Fortune 500 companies. And so many of the calls went like this,
So when I was contacted by the Parks Department about a $10,000 seed-grant initiative to help develop waterfront projects, I thought they were really well-meaning, but a bit naive. I'd lived in this area all my life, and you could not get to the river, because of all the lovely facilities that I mentioned earlier.
Hi. I'm Jeff, and I'm a consumer experience specialist at Google. Today I am going to teach you how to remove an image from
Minus 100 minus 5. That's less than 35.
I picked those numbers because they're both perfect squares.
You say how many people have A positive would be 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 , 6 , 7 blood drops but each of those blood drops represent 8 people, so it would be 56 people have type A positive But, lets answer the actual question that they are asking us How many survey respondents have type O positive
It's going to be 96 minus 61. So the amount of time that elapses past 3 minutes is 96 minus 61, which is 35 minutes. So this right over here is going to be 3:35.
5 times q minus 7, over 12 is equal to 2/3. Let me just get rid of the 12 first. Let me multiply both sides of this equation by 12.
So delta y over delta x, When we go to the right, our change in x is 1.
This first way is literally viewing it as 2/3 six times. And this way is we're taking a fraction of the number 6. We're going 2/3 of the way to 6, which would get us to 4.
They believed that what made them vulnerable made them beautiful.
Let's do problem number five.
So 1 times 2, well, that's clearly just going to be equal to 2. And any number to the first power is just going to be equal to that number. And then we can go from there, and you will, of course, see the pattern.
5 is definitely an integer.
Well, the simpelest thing is: you can take these 1kg blocks off of the left-hand side, but remember, if you just took these blocks off of the left-hand side, and it was balanced before, now the left-hand side will be lighter and it will move up. But we want to keep it balanced so we can keep saying 'equal'. That this mass is equal to that mass.
I have a square here divided into one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine equal sections. And we've already seen that if we were to shade in one of these sections, if we were to select one of these sections, let's say the middle one right over here, this is one out of the nine equal sections.
And this is going to be the same thing as-- and we know this from our exponent properties-- 5 times the square root of 3 times 3 times the square root of 13. Now, what's the square root of 3 times 3? Well, that's the square root of 9.
Find the sum of -15 + (-46) + (-29) To do this, let's just first visualize what each of these numbers look like. So I'm going to draw a number line for each of them.
Let me rewrite 100 trillion in billions.
Something called the law of diffusion of innovation, if you don't know the law, you know the terminology. The first 2.5% of our population are our innovators.
And I think it's fairly-- I don't think anyone has-- we can mathematically understand it and manipulate it and see how it relates to electricity. We actually will show you the electrostatic force and the magnetic force are actually the same thing, just viewed from different frames of reference. I know that all of that sounds very complicated and all of that.
Let's say I had the situation-- let me give me a couple of problems-- if I said three over x is equal to, let's just say five. So, what we want to do -- this problem's a little unusual from everything we've ever seen. Because here, instead of having x in the numerator, we actually have x in the denominator.
Is this divisible by 3? This is an emergency! Tell me as quickly as possible!
3/2 is the exact same thing as 1 and 1/2, if we were to write it as a mixed number. So it's more than 1 cup of wheat flour. And he mixes his that with 3/4 cups of regular flour.
The square root of 2 times 2 is 2.
So if I just said eight (8) divided by two (2), that would be a positive four (4), but since exactly one of these two numbers are negative, this one right over here, the answer is going to be negative.
So one and 9/12ths we can also write that, actually we could've simplified this right from the get go, cause both 21 and 12 are divisible by three, but now we can just divide nine, we can simplify 9/12ths, divide both the numerator and the denominator by three, we then get one and three over four, one and 3/4ths.
When x is 0, y is 0.
Let's see if this works 2 times 3 times 3 and 4 more ' to that?
If you have 1 multiplied by 10 five times, this right over here is going to be 1 followed by five 0's. One, two, three, four, five. Or it's going to be 100,000.
9 times 8 is 72. 9 times 2 is 18.
You add 1 to both sides. The left-hand side just becomes 4x is greater than or equal to 7 plus 1 is 8. Divide both sides by 4.
So 56, and you might say, where is the decimal point? Well, there's implicitly a decimal point right over there. You divide by 10 once, you're going to get a smaller number.
5 is not included because 5 is not less than 4.
'x + 5.' this is an expression right over here.
So 27 goes into 190 - And we already played this game.
So this is going to be equal to 7.23 times, we could say times one hundred, but we want to stay in scientific notation, so I'll write times ten squared. Now we have this character right here. What's our first non-zero term?
-1, -2, -3, and so on. So if I start at 1 right here, so 1-3 so I go 1,2,3, I end up at -2 So 1-3=-2
So just to 1.6. Notice, every time x is increasing by 1, y is increasing by 0.4.
1,500 is equal to 1,500. So this is not a true statement. But what if I want to eat up to and including 1,500 calories?
I'll do it on the side, so 41,790 divided by 210.
so now we have a very very very interesting problem on the left hand side of the scale I have two different types of unknown masses one of these X masses and we know that they have the same identical mass, we call that identical each of them having a mass of X But then we have this other blue thing and that has a mass of Y, which isn't necessarily going to be the same as the mass of X. We have two of these X's and a Y.It seems like the total mass or it definitely is the case, their total mass balance it out to these 8 kg right over here.
Seventeen minus sixteen is one. Remainder, one.
So I'll go one, two, three, four, five, so it's going to be equal to 5.16, so I take 5 there, and then everything else is going to be behind the decimal point, times 10, so this is going to be the largest power of 10 that fits into this first non-zero number. So it's one, two, three, four, five, so 10 to the minus 5 power. Let me do another example.
1/4 times 8x is 2x, plus 1/4 times 12 is 3. Either way, we got the same answer.
We're essentially going to be---in a more modern form---studying what Euclid studied 2,300 years ago. To really tighten our reasoning of different statements and be sure that when we say something, we can really prove what we're saying. This is really some of the most fundamental, "real" mathematics that you will do.
The abolsute value of this arrow right here (the absolute value of negative 3) is 3. So we're already 3 to the left, now we're moving 7 more to left
We're now going to be in the next section, section four in our fourth test. And that's problem one, 594. Problem one. x minus y is equal to 8. y is equal to 3z.
We are asked to identify the percent amount and base in this problem.
So you divide this 4 by 4, you get 1.
Obviously, 0 divided by anything is still 0. That's pretty straightforward. And of course, you can't divide anything by 0
In this video I'm going to do a bunch of example slope problems. Just as a bit of review, slope is just a way of measuring the inclination of a line. And the definition-- we're going to hopefully get a good working knowledge of it in this video-- the definition of it is a change in y divided by change in x.
Our change in y is 3.
So just graphing that on a number line, we just put a
Use substitution to solve for x and y and we have a system of equations here. The first equation is 2y=x+7 and the second equation here is x=y-4. So what we want to do when we say substitution is we want to substitute one of the variables with an expression so that we have an equation in only one variable then we can solve for it.
Welcome to the presentation on averages. Averages is probably a concept that you've already used before, maybe not in a mathematical way. But people will talk in terms of, the average voter wants a politician to do this, or the average student in a class wants to get out early.
"And what do you mean with Western world?" I said. "Well, that's long life and small family, and Third World is short life and large family." So this is what I could display here.
So it's essentially two radii. You got one radius there and then you have another radius over there. We call this distance along the widest point of the circle, the diameter.
And they want to know, what is the average of the areas in the two regions. Well they're the same number, right? So if you average two of the same number, the average is going to be that number.
If you give me any number in this interval, its absolute value is going to be less than 7 and 1/2 because all of these numbers are less than 7 and 1/2 away from 0. Let me draw it on the number line, which they want us to do anyway. So if this is the number line right there, that is 0, and we draw some points, let's say that this is 7, that is 8, that is negative 7, that is negative 8.
That year she introduced me to dance, and thus began my tryst with classical dance. Since then -- it's been four decades now -- I've trained with the best in the field, performed across the globe, taught young and old alike, created, collaborated, choreographed, and wove a rich tapestry of artistry, achievement and awards.
(They're both in the 10's place.) And later in this video it should be clear - or I'll hopefully make it clear - why that's a good thing to do. Alright.
Someone walks up to you on the street and says two thousand, nine hundred and forty-three. Quick! Is this divisible by nine?
8 is not prime.
We already summed up the digits here, 48 is not divisible by 9, if you're not sure, you can add up the digits there and get 12, 12 is definitely not divisible by 9. So this thing right over here is not divisible by 9.
Something plus 160 is 360, you could in your head say, well, that something must be 200. 200 plus 160 is 360.
We are on problem 63. The height of a triangle is 4 inches greater than twice its base.
Negative 10, negative 9, negative 8, negative 7. There's a bunch of numbers here. You know, dot, dot, dot.
15 is 3 times 5, and now both of these are prime. So we need something that has two 2's and a 3, so let's look at the 12 right there. So our denominator has to have at least two 2's and a 3, so
One, two, three, four. And then we could cancel out the zeros. We could say, OK, let's divide the top and the bottom by 10.
Find the multiplicative inverse of each of the following. Now, all that means is if I have some number a, its inverse is going to be 1/a. When I take a number and I multiply it by its multiplicative inverse, I'm going to get a/a, which is equal to 1.
