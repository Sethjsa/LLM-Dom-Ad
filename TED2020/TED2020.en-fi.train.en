And when I went back six months later, I said, "Where's your husband?"
And my idea is also being used now all over Kenya for scaring other predators like hyenas, leopards, and it's also being used to scare elephants away from people's farms.
The robot is transparent, just like you would hold a young child during the first insecure steps.
And you might imagine education would be the way that happens, but too often, it's not.
But freedom doesn't exist if you don't use it, and what whistleblowers do, and what people like Gayla Benefield do is they use the freedom that they have.
And one thing to notice is that perhaps there are states of human well-being that we rarely access, that few people access.
In a traditional classroom, you have homework, lecture, homework, lecture, and then you have a snapshot exam.
(Laughter) Which I think is just fascinating.
They're infinitely removed from nothingness, but they fall infinitely short of complete fullness.
If he turns to a particular page, he finds an annotation by maybe an expert or a friend of ours that gives him a little bit of additional information about whatever is on that particular page.
My grandfather was the guy who kind of got me into all sorts of these things.

So he's Mario. He's our son.
Sir Thomas Brown wrote in 1642, "I am the happiest man alive.
It's not as complex as it looks. That's not the issue.
So there's that. Then the distribution.
The theory of evolution is telling us that once again, we're wrong.
I've already said that many individual evolutionists, like the Pope, are also religious, but I think they're deluding themselves.
Grzegorz from Warsaw said, "Ah, for me it is fear.
So he was using social media in private.
It's difficult to disappear without a trace.

And you can still also go outside and enjoy the greatest show in the universe, which is, of course, the universe itself.
OK, so here I've basically thrown together a little creature.
So, what can we do about it?
A 2014 study showed that 57 percent of eighth- and ninth-grade students said, "Science isn't me."
CA: The book had three, yours had four.
May none of your non-cancer cells become endangered species.
The bad news is that you have to look hard to find them.
(Laughter) And I said, "Shallow affect, an inability to experience a range of emotions."
Her desire to explore the physical world to its fullest would shape her life, and eventually, inspire a radical new philosophy.
They're not doing anything out of the ordinary.
The Hunter-Gatherer Age lasted several million years.
These differences were highly significant.
54 percent of their mortality was due to them spearing each other.
When it comes to the hard problem, that's the question of why is it that all this behavior is accompanied by subjective experience?
We paid a lot of money for that information, be we didn't get it.
So, what to do?
Thank you for staying here. We're all so grateful."
(Laughter) I told her that I wanted to up the ante and hold my breath longer than any human being ever had.
We had to take them out, which we did.
This very focused time we get to spend together is something we cherish and anticipate the entire year.
(Laughter) (Applause) Now, personally, I think I'm not the first one who has done this analysis, but I'll leave this to your good judgment.
What about the water?"
Now, I don't know about you guys, but judging the circumstances, right, any judge in the whole world, would look at the statistics and the evidence, and they would find any government of old guilty of child abuse.
Turn off all of those things that are also going to excite the brain.
Here's what they said: "We find that financial incentives can result in a negative impact on overall performance."
Now you have white knuckles and you're gripping the steering wheel.
Oh, you're all shaking your heads, but only a few of you are shaking your heads very firmly.
Why? Why have we made so little progress?
What's more beautiful, I thought to myself, this image of a young couple who has just fallen in love or the idea of these two people holding onto this image for decades?
And all the stuff I could afford, I didn't like.
Their cooperation is very rigid.
Bats, I've even suggested, use perceived hues, such as red and blue, as labels, internal labels, for some useful aspect of echoes -- perhaps the acoustic texture of surfaces, furry or smooth and so on -- in the same way as swallows or indeed, we, use those perceived hues -- redness and blueness, etc. -- to label long and short wavelengths of light.
These are movies. They're fiction.
So for the most part, I spent my time at home reading books and watching TV or playing video games.
Do it enough until you actually become it and internalize.
But it too is being threatened by the massive amount of water being drawn from the Athabasca, which feeds these wetlands, and also the incredible toxic burden of the largest toxic unlined impoundments on the planet, which are leaching in to the food chain for all the species downstream.
So chances are really, really good that your insula is going off right now, but I won't kid myself to think this means you love me.
And three years ago, one of the things I learned how to do was to become invisible.
And to defend my title -- like judokas do and sportsmen -- I thought, well let's go back in 2005 -- and I won again.
I have some ones that were long lasting: from the age of five to 15, this was supposed to be my side occupation, and it led to a sense of failure.
I recently retired from the California Highway Patrol after 23 years of service.
And incidentally, that means that people don't like us. Right?

So the different tricks that Matthieu and I and others know about increasing the amount of positive emotion in your life are 15 to 20 percent tricks, getting more of it.
I'm going to show you six, if I can, solutions for helping to save the world.
We can understand how to understand the data from the microwave background radiation that was set down 13.72 billion years ago -- and yet, we can do calculations today to predict how it will look and it matches.
It was the mountains, it was difficult.
But business as usual means that in 50 years, there may be no coral reefs -- and no commercial fishing, because the fish will simply be gone.
I'm going to give you an example of three of these tools through which to converse with the body.
So this is China, a civilization-state, rather than a nation-state.
One of its primary goals was to make it easier for residents of wealthy communities in Westchester County to go to Manhattan.
The second shock hurts just as much, and the third and the fourth and the fifth.
Excuse me. Thank you. It's been a joy.
As Peter Levine has said, the human animal is a unique being endowed with an instinctual capacity to heal and the intellectual spirit to harness this innate capacity.
The top-note answer was and is "Because it's time."
In the long duration chairs, you're transported to the big place where you're going to see the work.
However, what we have learned more recently is that this is one of the unique structures of the adult brain where new neurons can be generated.
And this is the moment I decide I'm just going to give away my music for free online whenever possible, so it's like Metallica over here, Napster, bad; Amanda Palmer over here, and I'm going to encourage torrenting, downloading, sharing, but I'm going to ask for help, because I saw it work on the street.
Now there's a mood to put some of that stuff back in place, but the lobbyists are already there trying to weaken the regulations after the legislation has just passed.
It's an illusion, like sunsets.
Dr. Yunus shared his story, explaining what that was, and what he had done with his Grameen Bank.
But there aren’t just rules about how to play; there are rules about when to play.
The trajectory tells us a great deal.
All she was telling me is that she doesn't trust her leaders.
The paradigm is, once you get 10 in a row on that, it keeps forwarding you to more and more advanced modules.
What are we seeing?
They need to help us shop.
(Laughter) It's hard to listen when somebody's that negative.
I've really tried to solve some big problems: counterterrorism, nuclear terrorism, and health care and diagnosing and treating cancer, but I started thinking about all these problems, and I realized that the really biggest problem we face, what all these other problems come down to, is energy, is electricity, the flow of electrons.
During that time, there have been modern technologies that have really transformed the way that field biologists do their work.
Secondly, often the best way to learn what people really want is to launch your service.
And so, what I'm showing over here, these are actual exercises that I started writing for my cousins.
So we might have a wild idea, but we’re afraid to share it with anybody else.

While licking my wounds, I got a lot of inspiration from my battles against Deep Blue.
I give you a candle, some thumbtacks and some matches.
And I told her, "I'm going to Scotland the next day."
The good news is that when we talk about clean transportation and different mobility, we're not talking about some distant utopia out there.
The night before I was heading for Scotland, I was invited to host the final of "China's Got Talent" show in Shanghai with the 80,000 live audience in the stadium.
Do those sorts of things that you know are going to ease you off into the honey-heavy dew of slumber.
No? it's hard to, isn't it?
Guys, I can see this guy in front me in full 3D.
We are talking about -- around about 15,000 lines of code.
We don't work from offices.
Global GDP is 10 times bigger than it was in 1950 and that increase has brought prosperity to billions of people, but the global economy has also become incredibly divisive, with the vast share of returns to wealth now accruing to a fraction of the global one percent.
Our job is to look and say, "You know what? You're imperfect, and you're wired for struggle, but you are worthy of love and belonging."
Ingenious TEDTalks, much more this green color, etc., et.
Who knows what that is? Child: Uh, pear?
These DNA decisions also happen in other parts of the body.
Ben Kenobi is Obi Wan Kenobi. Holy shit! So it keeps us -- (Laughter) Have you guys not seen that?
We need new ways, better ways, to cope with poverty, wars and disease.
And so the paradigm is the teacher walks in every day, every kid works at their own pace -- this is actually a live dashboard from the Los Altos school district -- and they look at this dashboard.
As you heard in the film, anywhere else, not here.
How are we going to feed this world?
If there really are five systems at work in the mind, five sources of intuitions and emotions, then we can think of the moral mind as one of those audio equalizers that has five channels, where you can set it to a different setting on every channel.
Maybe their greater ability to cooperate and adapt?
Maybe procrastinating does not cause creativity.
You have to keep well-slept, well-fed and propagating into the next generation, which in tribal times might have worked OK.
I think the chimpanzee in captivity who is the most skilled in intellectual performance is one called Ai in Japan -- her name means love -- and she has a wonderfully sensitive partner working with her.
It can be difficult to make the change.
And although I highly encourage you, all use honey.
And that is because it's us. It's private industry.
So the elders gave me some very sound and profound advice.
There's no way to quantify the psychological damage of those who were in the school, or who took part in rescue or cleanup efforts.
Will we continuously ship supplies from Planet Earth?
So it's possible to achieve, let's say, roughly 100-fold improvement in the cost of spaceflight if you can effectively reuse the rocket.
And, unfortunately, the powers in the Eurozone, in the Eurogroup, chose to maintain denial.
So we use this state-of-the-art encryption to bounce stuff around the Internet, to hide trails, pass it through legal jurisdictions like Sweden and Belgium to enact those legal protections.
He led them to America.
Then the animal learns to walk on a leash in the open and find targets.
That's the geek side.
The consequence of that is that all those nutrients that fuel the great anchoveta fisheries, of the sardines of California or in Peru or whatever, those slow down and those fisheries collapse.
So, this is a story about how we know what we know.
They followed these little shifts in your mental activity.
Well, the classical approach consists of applying intervention that would promote the growth of the severed fiber to the original target.
Could I have the second little video clip?
(Laughter) I'm an economist.
And as I look forward to what is next, it's been helpful to reflect on the things I've learned so far.
And the richest people over there -- there's one billion people, and they live above what I call the "air line" -- (Laughter) because they spend more than 80 dollars a day on their consumption.
I literally for three years made everything -- every scrap of paper, everything online, that this theater did.
And a small indulgence, like eating one scoop of ice cream, is more likely to lead to a food binge in controlled eaters.
Try experiencing that on a Kindle.
So if the web was made entirely out of dragline silk, an insect is very likely to just bounce right off. But by having really, really stretchy capture spiral silk, the web is actually able to absorb the impact of that intercepted prey.
So, people have commented on how, "Well, you know, you brought back the ocean organisms and put them on the planet of Pandora."

What you see here is performance on that head-turn task for babies tested in Tokyo and the United States, here in Seattle, as they listened to "ra" and "la" -- sounds important to English, but not to Japanese.
I think the Eameses are wonderful examples of experimentation.
About four years ago, the New Yorker published an article about a cache of dodo bones that was found in a pit on the island of Mauritius.
The good news is that this is happening today.
We would love to think that your brain could tell whether you need to lose weight or not, but it can't.
So after all of our shows, we would sign autographs and hug fans and hang out and talk to people, and we made an art out of asking people to help us and join us, and I would track down local musicians and artists and they would set up outside of our shows, and they would pass the hat, and then they would come in and join us onstage, so we had this rotating smorgasbord of weird, random circus guests.
Now, I throw this slide up because it indicates to me that, even if SETI does hear something, can we figure out what they said?
And at Pittsburgh there are two big universities, Carnegie Mellon and University of Pittsburgh.
And those who didn't die lived often very tethered to the ground, could not experience pleasure, could not trust, because when you're vigilant, worried, anxious, and insecure, you can't lift your head to go and take off in space and be playful and safe and imaginative.
And this did not happen.
You might struggle to see that at the back, because the gap is quite small.
Nevertheless, they were married soon after.
Which is a savings.
Well I don't know.

And now a card with a contrast of five of clubs.
("What's a Jurassic Park?") Now, what is the story here?
(Laughter) Michael Shermer: Thank you very much. Thank you. Thanks.
My father has just built the best outhouse in our little village in Ukraine.
(Laughter) OK? What you do is you create what I call a mirror box.
And we asked them these questions, and we asked those questions of science graduates, and they couldn't answer them.
Remember I quoted him before with this line: "Surrendered people obey God's word, even if it doesn't make sense."
One early form left an imprint, like it died only yesterday.
I had figured out the exact amount of shrinkage I achieved going from a wax master to a bronze master and blown this up big enough to make a 3D lithography master of this, which I will polish, then I will send to the mold maker and then I will have it done in bronze. Or: There are several people who own originals, and I have been attempting to contact them and reach them, hoping that they will let me spend a few minutes in the presence of one of the real birds, maybe to take a picture, or even to pull out the hand-held laser scanner that I happen to own that fits inside a cereal box, and could maybe, without even touching their bird, I swear, get a perfect 3D scan. And I'm even willing to sign pages saying that I'll never let anyone else have it, except for me in my office, I promise.
And she went, "Ha ha. There's no such thing."
It doesn't resonate with me. It's not how I chose to view the universe at a small scale.
But we had that habit in Sweden, you know, that we counted all the child deaths, even if we didn't do anything about it.
Now you may say, "Okay, so we're eating 500 grams just by accident."
Or is it just some weird shadows on the tree?
And that journey -- that journey of transformation that occurs as you grow your meadow and as you keep your bees or you watch those native bees there -- is an extremely exciting one.
If you look at when they laugh, they're laughing with their friends.
So we find ourselves in a universe with the particular amount of dark energy we've measured simply because our universe has conditions hospitable to our form of life.
It enhances your empathy.
They do this because they've stripped the soil from all nutrients from growing the same crop over and over again.
One of my board members is an editor at a major global media company, but she never thought about this as a career path, until she met female role models at JAWS.
CA: Boys and girls watching, study physics.
It became a transaction for me, became sort of a trade.
Dream with us.
TEDx – oh my God, blinding light!
And about seven years before you're about to die, there's a spike.
But we wondered what role the human being played in this learning exercise.
But then I discovered something.
There actually is something here, but it's degraded.
I actually had done some research a few years before -- it's why the folder was there.
And the aquarium had a lot of big fish tanks but not a lot of invertebrate displays, and being the spineless guy, I thought, well I'll just go out in the field and collect these wonderful animals I had been learning about as a student and bring them in, and I built these elaborate sets and put them on display.
But I kept watching the news in case they came back, and were like, "Before he did it, he converted to Islam."
So, everything is not going to be up for grabs.
Can I go through them with you?"
I have wanted to believe and wanted you to believe that the system that has been good to me, that has made my life ever more seamless, is also the best system for you.
Now, also, back to the sort of big brands: labeling, I said earlier, is an absolute farce and has got to be sorted.
See, my thinking's bottom-up.
So we can benefit from the international community for education, English language training, job training, and more.
By the way, there's a shaft of nerves that joins the two halves of the brain, called the corpus callosum.

In women, blood vessels grow every month, to build the lining of the uterus.
So unless we have really universal and not national basic income, the deep problems are not going to go away.
(Laughter) OK, I'm not the only one whistling here.
Why didn't I start and make it bigger?
So I think half of my book advance went into sunscreen.
Does that mean that we can be grateful for everything?
A blood vessel exploded in the left half of my brain.
That's a large part of his job, and people think that if he doesn't do it, things will fall apart.
OK, let's go.
How's it going?
So there's a whole raft of things associated with sleep loss that are more than just a mildly impaired brain, which is where I think most people think that sleep loss resides.
Only I describe one side of your brain as autopilot and the other side as emergency brake.
And so then the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors came along, and they said, oh, well, we will hold the line.
I remember one story he told me about screws, and about how you need to have the right screw for the right job.

There was resistance for the old malaria drugs, until we got the new drugs.
But literally the next day they were like, "Can you start in two weeks?"
Now we all, or a big part of us, use Gmail or one of their competitors, but these services are especially popular in totalitarian states like Iran, where dissidents use foreign services like Gmail because they know they are more trustworthy than the local services and they are encrypted over SSL connections, so the local government can't snoop on their discussions.
Everything I do, and everything I do professionally -- my life -- has been shaped by seven years of work as a young man in Africa.
By appreciating the darkness when you design the light, you create much more interesting environments that truly enhance our lives.
Every time I read Chekhov and his unique vision of human life, I'm reminded of why I too became a writer.
If the two bodies are spinning very rapidly, I have that same chirp, but with a modulation on top of it, so it kind of goes: whir, whir, whir!
And so the key to being original is just a simple thing of avoiding the leap from step three to step four.
So what's going on?
We don't want Brazil to become like Russia.
I'm interested in what I like to call the "triple bottom line" that sustainable development can produce.
But its common name is "random selection."
But the enormity of the tragedy can't be measured only by the number of deaths and injuries that took place.
And here's the same child three weeks post-operation, with the right eye open.
We've said that sleep is complicated and it takes 32 years of our life.
I found local sustainable funding to get every single school in the area from the junk, onto the fresh food: six-and-a-half grand per school.
After a few weeks of recovery, we will implant a programmable pump to deliver a personalized pharmacological cocktail directly to the spinal cord.
Those perceptions of reality go extinct.
100 percent of us will be on the receiving end of unhealthy relationship behaviors and 100 percent of us will do unhealthy things.
Now, I do it quicker, better.
I decided to meet other people like me and find that out.
And as soon as I put those first YouTube videos up, something interesting happened.

Encouragement seems to be the key.
Even in the first seven days, there was one parody for every other day of the week.
(Laughter) And guess what?
Committed sex is premeditated sex.
And when I think about that, I think about a vacation we had in Antarctica a few years ago, which was clearly the best vacation I've ever had, and I think of it relatively often, relative to how much I think of other vacations.
When you have 21 minutes to speak, two million years seems like a really long time.
I thought if I'm going to understand dinosaur evolution, I'd have to go back to those beds where they had picked up fragments, go back to a time and a place where the earliest dinosaurs existed.
And you know what it feels like: all of that uncertainty while you’re left out in the hallway while the docs are dealing with some more urgent case in one of the emergency rooms, wondering what the heck’s going on.
And so exotic as this picture is, it may one day be grounded in observations, establishing the existence of other universes.
Normally, a root will find phosphorus all by itself.
You've seen recently, corn to ethanol is just a bad experiment.
Even a flood tide of economic growth is not going to get us there, if it just raises the mega-yachts and the super-wealthy and leaves the rest behind.
But I'm also a skeptic.
They're doing it at the district level.
That's all he's carrying.
I said, "Pearl necklace?" "Yeah."
My dad was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis in the prime of his life.
So in this particular case, it's about the human digestive system.
And perhaps the clearest example of this is stoning adulterers.
But that's too complicated for today, so I'll simplify it for you, and I give you one average point for each survey.
And it has been my home these years.
This is something Jamie Oliver talked about the other day.
And we just seem to be unable to figure out what to do.
She's investing in the process, not in the outcome.
And it's healthier than the United States.
And it turns out that the void isn't this endless lonely expanse at all, but instead it's full of all sorts of other people, also staring out into it and also wanting to be heard.
They see around corners, shaping their future, not just reacting to it.
And then the other point is, we have to have sustainable means of power generation anyway, electricity generation.
The God theory is not just a bad theory.
Then last minute, I'm thinking, 'Can't do this. This is wrong.' My buddy says, 'C'mon, let's do this.' I say, 'Let's do this.'" And those three words, Tony's going to remember, because the next thing he knows, he hears the pop.
Here are the numbers one to 12 as I see them -- every number with its own shape and character.
This is what evolution tells us. And it's true. It's kind of unbelievable.
(Laughter) I'm at a business school, so that's what we do.
By the end of this century, it will all be gone.
I've come, however, on a special mission on behalf of my constituency, which are the 10-to-the-18th-power -- that's a million trillion -- insects and other small creatures, and to make a plea for them.
Let's have a look at this short movie now.
Shift work.
If I were to get a better job, if I were to get more money, if my boss would have a heart attack, if only I was married, if only my wife would leave me -- (Laughter) if only I had children, if my children would grow up and go to college ...
So here we are, at a very microscopic scale, swimming around.
But can you reconcile that?
The new brain is easier than the old brain.
In fact -- (Applause) Thank you.
The bottom line is, time is a powerful force.
If you're going to explain this as a bag of tricks, then it's not real consciousness, whatever it is.
WK: This is my home. This is where I live.
Carbon-free electricity.

Extremely prophetic, by Thomas Dekker, another Elizabethan dramatist.
Not only will it get hotter, but at some point it's going to get so hot the oceans will evaporate.
Being the perpetual new face in class, I was frequently the target of bullies.
I'm sure that people here who work on, say, climate change and global warming, or on the future of the Internet, encounter people who have very strong opinions about what's going to happen next.
Zack and Chris came to the date-a-thon together.
Thank you very much.
That's the kind of radical idea that we need to explore if you want to have a purely reductionist brain-based theory of consciousness.
The abalone shell here.
So, since dying is a necessary part of life, what might we create with this fact?
I've failed miserably, many times.
Orange 2: I'd be sad too. (#thatslove) Orange 1: I'd so depressed if we ever broke up.
The answer is actually 186,540 miles, or seven times around the globe.
And you can see they're clearly sick.
This was recently done with a neuroscientific twist.
Thank you for listening.
That's one reason why women are redefining their sexuality today.
So the correlation is low.
So I'm not saying that you should plant a meadow of pot, but a pot in a meadow.
So I started gathering a lot of different types of material in my studio and just experimenting and trying this out, trying that out, and seeing what types of creatures I can come up with.
When it was my turn to shoot, my father helped me hold the rifle to my shoulder and explained how to aim at the target about 30 yards off.
I said, "Can I see some evidence for this?"
My son never feels like getting off his DS. That's my job!
And here's one of the early experiments: (Music) So this is called "The Wilderness Downtown."
And I went out and I interviewed person after person who was suffering with depression.
In science, your credibility is everything, and people were snickering in the hallways, giving me stares, looks of disgust -- afraid to be near me.
YNH: Well, I think it makes it even more likely, and more likely that it will happen faster, because in times of crisis, people are willing to take risks that they wouldn't otherwise take.
This is a discovery of significant importance — you see where I'm going — because it squares the circle.
On at least one, and maybe only one of those planets, primitive life evolved, which evolved over millions of years into things that walked upright and left footprints about three and a half million years ago in the mud flats of Tanzania, and eventually left a footprint on another world.
We are all concerned with things that we see in the world that we are aware of.
They were afraid of embarrassing themselves, of looking stupid.
How can it be that this thought in my brain can move material objects?
(Laughter) But what was interesting was, the Pakistani Muslim guy -- see, he gives a bad name to Muslims and Middle Easterners and Pakistanis from all over the world.
I think I do it the same way. I like to, so I know where it is.
But we've come a long way.
And that's how DNA can remember what happens in the past.
I feel more, in fact, I think, because I can feel sadness without nullity.
And if you don't think you look good in something, you're also probably right.
Just an amazing animal, it can change color and texture to match the surroundings.
By peering through the lens of a telescope we discovered that the Earth is not the unmoving center of reality, and by peering through the lens of the theory of evolution we discovered that spacetime and objects are not the nature of reality.
More than half the world's population is involved in building this device in southern France, which is a nice place to put an experiment.
Well I say, more power to him.
You see somebody and you think you have an impulse, they look interesting? Walk over there!
(Laughter) So what have I realized, being on the receiving end of all this ugliness?
It's a story about this woman, Natalia Rybczynski.
But one of the major factors contributing to memory consolidation is, you guessed it, a good night's sleep.
Now, some of you are not going to like the results of this study -- (Laughter) But there is good evidence that Firefox and Chrome users significantly outperform Internet Explorer and Safari users.
And I'm telling you, it's not even close.
So they poke at it and peck at it.
So by then, Robert had understood that very likely his patients were suffering from depression even after being cured of their cancer, because the cancer drug had stopped newborn neurons from being generated.
We can change things, but we have to actively change.
Maybe, after a period of practice, you can dispense with the mirror, unlearn the paralysis, and start moving your paralyzed arm, and then, relieve yourself of pain."
A predator. Maybe 25 pounds, or 10 kilograms.
But as many people have said, there's a large attempt to suppress what's going on.
At this time this was an N of 20. Now there's an N of about 100.
It's got living coral, fish all over the place, crystal clear water, and you go, "How did that happen?"
No, of course not.
So this is really nothing, this is just a small crisis.
And if we give antidepressants, then we increase the production of these newborn neurons, and we decrease the symptoms of depression, establishing a clear link between neurogenesis and depression.
Management teams seem increasingly disconnected from their staff. (Laughter) A recent survey said that 27 percent of bosses believe their employees are inspired by their firm.
And they may be gone, but they're never really away.
It's going towards India, not from India.

But in St. John's, I was in the lower quarter.
Over the next 20 years he'd have 22 surgeries, including four spine operations, and hip replacement after hip replacement.
First, of course you know, a leader needs the guts to stand out and be ridiculed.
And I also believe that what happened over there in Turkey can happen anywhere.
Now as I think about that, I'm pulling up all of that specific information.
In other words, he was unwilling to treat this as anything but a concrete problem, and he was used to camels being in villages, and he was quite unable to use the hypothetical, to ask himself what if there were no camels in Germany.
And I started to go back to this place, and I noticed that I was doing my most important work there invisibly just by sitting still, and certainly coming to my most critical decisions the way I never could when I was racing from the last email to the next appointment.
In medicine, I think a lot of people are deeply disillusioned with the kind of quick-fix mentality you find in conventional medicine.
See it up there?
But I'm here today to give you a choice.
It was written by Russell Baker, who used to write an "Observer" column in the New York Times.
And if you are told from your earliest days that nothing good is going to come from your community, that it's bad and ugly, how could it not reflect on you?
I think it's because students are always late and they're pretty smart.
So what we do in my lab is we tempt people with virtue and vice by using money.
And Saul has no choice. He's got no one else who's come forward.
Do you feel like you have space and room to breathe?
And everything, they used to call it Madiba magic.
In the industry -- I don't know whether you care about this, or how much time I have to go into this.
When I was President of the American Psychological Association, they tried to media-train me.
(Laughter) This is not that catchy catchphrase.
Are these factors taken into consideration when land-use policy is decided?
This idea of, in order for connection to happen, we have to allow ourselves to be seen, really seen.

Why has it accelerated lately?
There are now three people on the planet for every one of us that existed in 1946; within 40 years, there'll be four.
She introduced them to a book about the Southern life that they had left behind.
It's also really important to start practicing using your voice to talk about your own needs.
My most recent book -- my previous book was called "The Know-It-All," and it was about the year I spent reading the Encyclopedia Britannica from A to Z in my quest to learn everything in the world, or more precisely from Aak, which is a type of East Asian music, all the way to Zwyiec, which is -- well, I don't want to ruin the ending.
I'm still excited by technology, but I believe, and I'm here to make the case, that we're letting it take us places that we don't want to go.
Small animals eat insects.
But I propose to you that the sequence of microbes that occur on rotting mushrooms are essential for the health of the forest.
But what I haven't explained is what sleep is about.
So then she'd get another penguin and try this ballet-like sexy display sliding down this iceberg like this. (Laughter) And she would sort of bring them over to me and offer it to me.
Mind you, there's 216 million dollars' worth of change lost every year, but I'm not sure I can depend on that ROI from crows.
Tomato soup, peanut butter, chocolate, noodles -- any processed food that you're eating contains insects, because insects are here all around us, and when they're out there in nature they're also in our crops.
They had to fit two criteria: they had to be old enough to be able to understand the whole concept of the age of reason, and not yet seven.
Usually, we look for the difference between us and all the other animals on the individual level.
I think this is particularly true if we think about the sort of -- I think what’s very different about design is that we go through these two very distinctive modes of operation.
There was only one variable that separated the people who have a strong sense of love and belonging and the people who really struggle for it.
This is a secret identity kit.
In fact, I'm giving you three examples, six minutes each, during this talk.
Now, Sylvia Browne -- just to show you -- she actually gets 700 dollars for a 20 minute reading over the telephone, she doesn't even go there in person, and you have to wait up to two years because she's booked ahead that amount of time.
Nobody knew it was an actor.
In this one, because the auction was actually so controversial, Profiles in History, the auction house that sold this -- I think in 1995 for about 100,000 dollars -- they actually included -- you can see here on the bottom -- not just a front elevation, but also a side, rear and other side elevation.
As I realized, just like with many many things in my life that I actually love, I adapt to it.
It's simply to use language around them, because the driving force in language acquisition is to understand what others, that are important to you, are saying to you.
I've gone and had an fMRI myself, to see how my visual cortex is ticking over.
This has to be described as an adventure, not a burden.
He said, "If you get scared, you close your eyes, ya, and she'll go away."
We live in a world of states, non-states, and in-between, and the more states are weak, like in the Middle East today, the more non-state actors step in and fill that gap.

And this person was very forceful and said, "Look, that's the only way you'll ever do it."
Paralysis was an opening for him.
And there he is, his droopy little eyes up here.
The other kinds of effects of climate change -- this is coral bleaching. It's a beautiful picture, right?
And you say, "I love you, your wife loves you, your mother loves you."
And they slaughtered them, used the fat throughout the winter for cooking.
And we're understanding. And you show compassion.
AK: So in short: to be super crisp, the camera that you see on the screen has a wider field of view than the human eye.
I would take camera LED lights and a bungee cord and strap it on my waist and I would videotape my belly button, get a different perspective, and see what it does.
In fact, you're not even allowed to stand where this gentleman is standing, at the foaming, slippery waters at the threshold.
Maybe you can remove them altogether to make that better.
You know, that is very exciting for us, because it demonstrates that things were changing slowly and progressively, and that evolution is in the making.
And blue-chip medical colleges everywhere are starting to study these things to find out how they work, and what we might learn from them.
So that's reassuring, you know.
And as every relationship comes to an end, ours went too.
There was an age in the Age of Empires when you needed those people who can survive under threat.
(Laughter) Exact equivalent.
I know, easier said than done.
YNH: Yes, very much so.
This is not a supplementary vitamin for the soul.
The reason why I'm here today, in part, is because of a dog -- an abandoned puppy I found back in the rain, back in 1998.
And we have one.
And some of the research now is showing that people on the spectrum actually think with the primary visual cortex.
But then the anger and the depression about my father's death set in.
So I felt that I needed to do two things.
This is where I live. I live in Kenya, at the south parts of the Nairobi National Park.
When I conduct this experiment, a bunch of stuff comes up: vast wealth, trophy spouse, good health, lots of travel, time, etc, etc, etc.
And this isn't some sort of crystal-waving nonsense.
We see some food that looks good, our brain says, "Calories! ... Survival!"
How many of you have seen the Alfred Hitchcock film "The Birds"?
To give you a better sense, I'm going to show you a little bit of what students see.

And at the end of the food chain, we are eating them as well.
This is not a new idea.
There's four family members that come in every day.
We can also then plot it by time, which obviously, for the data geek in me, is very fascinating.
They did it within two or three degrees of the pole, to maintain similarity between continents.
And we are abusing this great power we have to be wise stewards, and we're destroying the world.
(Music ends) Couldn't you just listen to that all day?
Now you don't find several thousand targets in that area.
Unfortunately, at the same time as we're discovering this treasure trove of potentially habitable worlds, our own planet is sagging under the weight of humanity.
We found that it did.
We've gone from people who confronted a concrete world and analyzed that world primarily in terms of how much it would benefit them to people who confront a very complex world, and it's a world where we've had to develop new mental habits, new habits of mind.
And I thought that I could kind of do this piecemeal as I was traveling.
So this is a study we did with Vicki Horner.
I really got close to design again.
It's a really fast commute, only 30 seconds, and we never get tired of looking out that window.
But I kept dreaming.
This makes the heart look less complicated because the atria have several incoming veins attached.
Well, surprisingly enough, it's good in many ways.
And it's only in learning to watch the mind in this way that we can start to let go of those storylines and patterns of mind.
(Laughter) But now kids with degrees are often heading home to carry on playing video games, because you need an MA where the previous job required a BA, and now you need a PhD for the other.
The world we now live in looks like this.
Our only chance of long-term survival is not to remain inward-looking on planet Earth, but to spread out into space.
Another consequence of metals being so easy to recycle by humans is that a lot of our stuff from the developed world -- and sadly to say, particularly from the United States, where we don't have any recycling policies in place like here in Europe -- finds its way to developing countries for low-cost recycling.
And this is valuable feedback that we can use to understand what's going on inside of ourselves.
Not even sitting there reminiscing about the past or planning for the future.
Have you ever eaten a booger long past your childhood?
Just to give you an example, when I went to Dikika, where Selam was found, in '99 -- and it's about 500 kilometers from Addis Ababa, the capital of Ethiopia.
They affect that part of DNA with the instructions for molecular machines that reduce stress.
We think, because there are chemical hooks in heroin, as you took it for a while, your body would become dependent on those hooks, you'd start to physically need them, and at the end of those 20 days, you'd all be heroin addicts. Right?
Would you get a divorce?
(Laughter) There was big stuff back then.
And in the lab we have shown that if we block the ability of the adult brain to produce new neurons in the hippocampus, then we block certain memory abilities.
And I started speaking in schools.
This is an artwork where three copies exist -- one at the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam, one at the Orsay in Paris and one at the Art Institute of Chicago, which, actually, currently is hosting a reunion of all three artworks physically, I think only for the second time ever.
I debate people who literally want to obliterate everything I believe in -- in some cases, who don't want me and people like me to even exist.

I love the Internet.
This started an incredible journey.
The money wasn't actually physically printed.
More people.
Why are all of these people in such a dark place?
This one is called the Good Country Index, and it does exactly what it says on the tin.
In the normal human mind, language covers up the visual thinking we share with animals.
And I learned how to slow my heart rate down.
How does a fascist decide whether a movie is a good movie or a bad movie?
We're always looking for little good things that people do.
In that complex record of fossils, there were times when lots of stuff seemed to be dying out very quickly, and the father/mother geologists called these "mass extinctions."
He'd reach out and grab the handle and turn it slightly one way, and it was 100 degrees too hot.
It may not be painless, quick or easy, but you can insist on a different ending to your story.
"Well, when did you decide?" He said, "As a kid.
Because you won't. Ever.
Understanding is the first step to improving, and while you can't make every unhealthy relationship healthy -- some you're going to have to leave behind -- you can do your part every day to do relationships better.
We call this the "end of history" illusion.
Classic case of the male leaving the female for the bottle.
Because what we do is we take fat from our butts and put it in our cheeks.
A few days later, we came out of the back of the low.
Isn't it just a lot of fun?"
And I said, "I'm great. I'm okay."
And when I think of the filmmakers who exist out there now who would have been silenced, you know -- who have been silenced in the past -- it's a very exciting thing.

And sure enough, when the year 2000 arrived, they did sell 900,000 -- in the first three days.
Now, the results are self-cleansing, and that's sort of the beauty of it, because Google measures relevance every hour, every day.
Ben and Jerry's doesn't have "liver and onion" ice cream, and it's not because they whipped some up, tried it and went, "Yuck!"
But the truth is it doesn't really matter which sage said it first, because it's still sage advice, even today.

Now teachers know exactly what the students have been up to, how long they've spent each day, what videos they've watched, when did they pause the videos, what did they stop watching, what exercises are they using, what have they focused on?
Also, those super-symmetric particles are very strong candidates for the dark matter.
He said, "Yeah, it's an amazing theory, it's like Star Trek.

But reality is there.
I come from a relatively small nation, Israel, and of eight million Israelis, I never met most of them.
There is unlikely to be a pension or a retirement age in 2030.
But it's the gathering around the table that's important, I think both in space and on Earth, because that's what cements a crew together.
And we did that, without using fire to damage the soil, and the plants are free to grow.
That's why you're here!
I just figured I'd made a mistake, and went back to the right, and so slid the chair in perfect synchronicity.
How about a few weeks?
We purified a chromosome from one microbial species -- roughly, these two are as distant as human and mice -- we added a few extra genes so we could select for this chromosome, we digested it with enzymes to kill all the proteins, and it was pretty stunning when we put this in the cell -- and you'll appreciate our very sophisticated graphics here.
The greatest mistake was to sign the application for the extension of a loan agreement in the end of February.
They can design for it. But how?

We have the opportunity now to bring together all the stakeholders to re-envision how this 28 acres can be better utilized for parkland, affordable housing and local economic development.
If your companions start to move quickly, you have to feel like you need to hurry up.
Because that's what it's about. It's about privacy.
So this is a problem, believe it or not, that reflective physicists really think a lot about, and at this point they tend to go metaphysical, say, well, maybe the set of laws that describes our universe, it's just one set of laws and it describes one part of reality, but maybe every consistent set of laws describes another part of reality, and in fact all possible physical worlds really exist, they're all out there.
And yet, in two million years, the human brain has nearly tripled in mass, going from the one-and-a-quarter-pound brain of our ancestor here, Habilis, to the almost three-pound meatloaf everybody here has between their ears.
(Laughter) And so the sins of the parents are visited on the poor children.

And so when people make decisions, and even though the results of the decisions are good, they feel disappointed about them; they blame themselves.
So, maybe what is happening is that there's a level of cheating we can't go over, but we can still benefit from cheating at a low degree, as long as it doesn't change our impressions about ourselves.
Their heads explode." The idea is to have an argument that is so powerful that it knocks out your opponents.
How would you feel if you were me? You have something extraordinary in your hand, but you are in the middle of nowhere?

In studies conducted in Papua New Guinea, Paul Ekman, the world's most renowned researcher on facial expressions, found that even members of the Fore tribe, who were completely disconnected from Western culture, and also known for their unusual cannibalism rituals, (Laughter) attributed smiles to descriptions of situations the same way you and I would.
It isn't the value or the size of a gift that truly matters, it is how you hold it in your heart.

Patient: These are two things.
Anyway, so I'd like your help in getting that signed up.
And if, but only if, we invest in the right green technology -- so that we can avoid severe climate change, and energy can still be relatively cheap -- then they will move all the way up here.
Now, of course our situation in the world can be understood at many levels -- from the level of the genome on up to the level of economic systems and political arrangements.
Screw Simon and the "We" thing. This is about me, right now!
