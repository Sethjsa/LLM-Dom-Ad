Let's play around with the Earth.
With gravitational waves, we should be able to see all the way back to the beginning.
What's next?
Steven Pinker: Very much. It would fit both in Wright's theory, that it allows us to enjoy the benefits of cooperation over larger and larger circles. But also, I think it helps us imagine what it's like to be someone else. I think when you read these horrific tortures that were common in the Middle Ages, you think, how could they possibly have done it, how could they have not have empathized with the person that they're disemboweling? But clearly, as far as they're concerned, this is just an alien being that does not have feelings akin to their own. Anything, I think, that makes it easier to imagine trading places with someone else means that it increases your moral consideration to that other person.
Other countries like Canada, Australia and the UK have nearly twice the amount of policewomen.

When I was a child, I loved to build stuff, to create complicated machines.
This is what wars look like when they continue.
These Christians -- who are these Christians?

My life was not going to be the same.
So given a dozen news stories, we will preferentially look at the negative news.

The character on the left is two mountains stacked on top of each other.
(Laughter) BG: Perfect answer.
No, what I'm suggesting is that we should leap off, we should increase our velocity so it's high, and we should leap off one side and go the other -- of course, having calculated our differential equation very carefully.
We think about a madeleine moistened in lavender tea.
I make them stand at attention like a soldier.
It just isn't appropriate.
(Laughter) I come from an island where many of us like to believe there's been a lot of continuity over the last thousand years.

Most famous, perhaps, chimpanzees.
Next up, we'll be beginning experiments to determine what happens to chemo drugs and pharmaceuticals during the composting process, and whether additional remediation will be needed.
So we see the plastic pieces floating slowly through the sensor, and the computer on board will process this image, and measure the size of each particle, so we have a rough estimate of how much plastic there is in the water.
If it was the case, we wouldn't have between 200 and 300 million cases of malaria every year, and we wouldn't have a million and a half deaths from malaria, and we wouldn't have a disease that was relatively unknown 50 years ago now suddenly turned into the largest mosquito-borne virus threat that we have, and that's called dengue fever.

Now, that's exactly the kind of process that I'm interested in, when we're thinking about sustainable materials.
Sometimes it takes months to even years to do something like this.
Now, we put out a lot of carbon dioxide every year -- over 26 billion tons.
And they do this with the same kind of split-second coordination that you see in natural swarms, in nature.
So I wonder: Why don't we just change the context in which the poor live?
