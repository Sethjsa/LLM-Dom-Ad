# LLM-Dom-Ad

Here we release our data splits for domain adaptation experiments. 

We include a 'train' split of 5000 sentence pairs and a 'test' split of 500 pairs.

We cover 7 languages paired with English: Czech (cs), German (de), Finnish (fi), French (fr), Lithuanian (lt), Romanian (ro), and Tamil (ta). We also cover 7 domains: EMEA, JRC-Acquis, KDE4, OpenSubtitles, QED, Tanzil, and TED2020. 

All data was obtained from [OPUS](https://opus.nlpl.eu/).
