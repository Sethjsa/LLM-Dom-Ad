There was therefore no common interface to all printers, hence the programmers often supported only a few selected models.

This setting defines which users sharing this folder should get "busy" periods in their freebusy lists and should see the alarms for the events or tasks in this folder. The setting applies to Calendar and Task folders only (for tasks, this setting is only used for alarms). Example use cases: if the boss shares a folder with his secretary, only the boss should be marked as busy for his meetings, so he should select "Admins", since the secretary has no admin rights on the folder. On the other hand if a working group shares a Calendar for group meetings, all readers of the folders should be marked as busy for meetings. A company-wide folder with optional events in it would use "Nobody" since it is not known who will go to those events.

The outside faces of the cubies have stickers of 6 different colors, one for each of the 6 faces of the main cube. As you rotate the slices, the stickers become shuffled and the faces of the main cube become a jumble of colors. It looks like a simple puzzle, but as you move further away from the starting position, you begin to realise, as one writer put it, that you are like a small child who has let go of a helium balloon only to see it move more and more beyond reach or hope of return.
This example makes use of back references as well as a character class (if you do not know what that is, please refer to the related documentation mentioned below).
Additional Information: %1
A Class defines the attributes and the methods of a set of objects. All objects of this class (instances of this class) share the same behavior, and have the same set of attributes (each object has its own set). The term Type is sometimes used instead of Class, but it is important to mention that these two are not the same, and Type is a more general term.

The addition of the --startonshow parameter tells ksystraycmd to start with only the tray icon visible (like the --hidden parameter), and to wait until the user activates the tray icon before running the target command. We've also used the --quitonhide parameter which tells ksystraycmd to terminate the target app whenever its window is hidden. Using both these parameters ensures that our & konsole; tray icon does n't waste resources when we are n't using it. Creating and destroying the target window as we do here prevents the standard icon and title handling of ksystraycmd from working, so we now need to specify the initial icon and tooltip explicitly too.

However, there is a problem with Solar Time. The Earth does not actually spin around 360 degrees in one Solar Day. The Earth is in orbit around the Sun, and over the course of one day, it moves about one Degree along its orbit (360 degrees/ 365.25 Days for a full orbit = about one Degree per Day). So, in 24 hours, the direction toward the Sun changes by about a Degree. Therefore, the Earth has to spin 361 degrees to make the Sun look like it has traveled 360 degrees around the Sky.

What was good in qtcups is all inherited by "kprinter", the new KDE print dialog (which is much improved over qtcups); what you liked about kups is now all in the KDEPrint Manager (accessible via the KDE Control Center or via the URL "print: / manager" from Konqueror) -- with more functionality and less bugs... Its former developer, Michael Goffioul, is now the developer of KDEPrint -- a very nice and productive guy and quick bug fixer...

For Matrox card try XMGA, for other cards either XVidix (if supported) or XVideo provide the best quality. With NVidia drivers you can also try XVMC output. If after trying hard you cannot make any of these work, you can use X11 output as the last resort. Video outputs that open a separate window instead of using KPlayer video area are not recommended.

KPhotoAlbum will try to read the image date from EXIF information in the image. If that fails it will try to get the date from the file's time stamp. However, this information will be wrong if the image was scanned in (you want the date the image was taken, not the date of the scan). If you only scan images, in contrast to sometimes using a digital camera, you should reply no. If you never scan images, you should reply yes, otherwise reply ask. This will allow you to decide whether the images are from the scanner or the camera, from session to session.

There are three situations when & kstars; must redraw the sky display very rapidly: when a new focus position is selected (and Use animated slewing is checked), when the sky is dragged with the mouse, and when the time step is large. In these situations, the positions of all objects must be recomputed as rapidly as possible, which can put a large load on the CPU. If the CPU cannot keep up with the demand, then the display will seem sluggish or jerky. To mitigate this, & kstars; will hide certain objects during these rapid-redraw situations, as long as the Hide objects while moving checkbox is selected. The timestep threshold above which objects will be hidden is determined by the Also hide if timescale greater than: timestep-spinbox. You can specify the objects that should be hidden in the Configure Hidden Objects group box.

sRGB was designed to contain colors easily displayed on consumer-oriented monitors and printed by consumer-oriented printers manufactured in 1996. This least-common-denominator set of viewable and printable colors - the technical term is "color gamut" - is much smaller than the set of colors we can see in the real world, much smaller than the set of colors today's digital cameras can capture, much smaller than the set of colors today's printers can print, and much smaller than the color gamut of the new wide gamut monitors that are beginning to enter the consumer market. For anyone who wants to make use of the wider color gamuts available today even at the consumer level, the gamut of sRGB is too small. Conversely, if you do n't intend to make use of an expanded gamut of colors at any point in your digital imaging workflow, then you do n't need to worry about non-sRGB color spaces and all the attending intricacies of color management.

Foomatic started out as the wrapper name for a set of different tools available from Linuxprinting. org These tools aimed to make the usage of traditional Ghostscript and other print filters easier for users and extend the filters' capabilities by adding more command line switches or explain the driver's execution data. Foomatic's different incarnations are & CUPS; -O-Matic, PPD-O-Matic, PDQ-O-Matic, LPD-O-Matic, PPR-O-Matic, MF-O-Matic and Direct-O-Matic. All of these allow the generation of appropriate printer configuration files online, by simply selection the suitable model and suggested (or alternate) driver for that machine. More recently, Foomatic gravitated towards becoming a "meta-spooling" system, that allows configuration of the underlying print subsystem through a unified set of commands (however, this is much more complicated than KDEPrint's & GUI; interface, which performs a similar task with regards to different print subsystems).

One major cause for data loss (often recoverable) is the unsafe removal of SDDs from a computer. Before data is saved from a computer memory to any attached device, it remains for some time in buffers. In hard drives this means seconds at most, whereas with SDDs it can be tens of minutes. Therefore, before you disconnect a flash device, always activate data flushing through software (often called "safely remove device").

Printers The KDE printing manager is part of KDEPrint which is the interface to the real print subsystem of your Operating System (OS). Although it does add some additional functionality of its own to those subsystems, KDEPrint depends on them for its functionality. Spooling and filtering tasks, especially, are still done by your print subsystem, or the administrative tasks (adding or modifying printers, setting access rights, etc.) What print features KDEPrint supports is therefore heavily dependent on your chosen print subsystem. For the best support in modern printing, the KDE Printing Team recommends a CUPS based printing system.

The geographic location chosen to represent Universal Time is Greenwich, England. The choice is arbitrary and historical. Universal Time became an important concept when European ships began to sail the wide open seas, far from any known landmarks. A navigator could reckon the ship's longitude by comparing the Local Time (as measured from the Sun's position) to the time back at the home port (as kept by an accurate clock on board the ship). Greenwich was home to England's Royal Observatory, which was charged with keeping time very accurately, so that ships in port could re-calibrate their clocks before setting sail.

Each cell can be filled with a display for one or more sensors. You can fill a cell by dragging a sensor from the sensor browser and dropping it over the cell. If there is more than one type of display available for that type of sensor, a popup menu will appear. You can then select which display you prefer to use. Certain types of displays can display more than one sensor. Add more sensors to a display by dragging them over from the sensor browser and dropping them over the already existing display.

You move by clicking on a vacant square or one you already own. If you click on a vacant square, you gain ownership over it and the squareâ s color changes to your playing color. Each time you click on a square, the value of the square increases by one. If the square's value reaches a maximum, its points are distributed among the squareâ s immediate neighbors (the points jump around). If a neighboring square happens to be owned by the other player, it gets taken over, together with all of its points, and changes to your playing color.

It is important to understand that the remote file resource does not add or remove individual items from the remote file, it simply saves the remote file over local cache when downloading and save the local cache over the remote file when uploading. Therefore, if the resource is read only, it makes sense to set the Automatic Reload option to a Regular interval, but if not (if the resource is writable), it is recommended to reload the file only before starting to edit it, by setting the Automatic Reload option to On startup, and to save it before exiting, by setting the Automatic Save option at least to On exit, or better yet, if you have a fast and stable connection to the remote file, set it to On every change to avoid data loss.

When it comes to color management, everyone wants to know, "which buttons do I push to get the results I want". Unfortunately, color management of necessity involves making informed choices at every step along the image-processing workflow. The purpose of this tutorial is to provide sufficient background information on color management, along with links to more in-depth information, to enable you to begin to make your own informed decisions, based on your own desired results.
This page of & kspread; 's configuration dialog box lets you choose the color of the sheet grid. If you do not want the grid to appear at all, uncheck the Show grid box in the Format Sheet Sheet Properties dialog.

In the beginning, wait on the top of the left (or better, right) branch of the leftmost ladders until the enemies in the middle climb to the middle of the center ladder. Then drop to the horizontal ladder, move all the way to the right and drop to the floor, thus trapping several enemies. You have to release most of the enemies from where they are trapped, to get the gold from various places. In particular, you have to release the enemies trapped on the left half of the floor to get at least one piece of gold. Once you pick up the last piece of gold, the enemies will swarm the center ladder, so you will have to decide which piece of gold to pick up last. A reasonable choice is the one held by the three enemies in the lowest leg of the 3, as is the one in the center arm of the 3.

The second type of memory, is called virtual or swap memory. This block of memory, is actually space on the hard drive. The operating system reserves a space on the hard drive for swap space. The operating system can use this virtual memory (or swap space), if it runs out of physical memory. The reason this is called swap memory, is the operating system takes some data that it does n't think you will want for a while, and saves that to disk in this reserved space. The operating system then loads the new data you need right now. It has swapped the not needed data, for the data you need right now. Virtual or swap memory is not as fast as physical memory, so operating systems try to keep data (especially often used data), in the physical memory.

The Colors settings of the & kcontrolcenter; allow you to control the colors that are used for various window elements, such as window titlebars, window backgrounds, text, and buttons. You can change the color of each window element by selecting the element from the drop down list and choosing a color for it. You can then save your changes by clicking on Save Scheme.... This will save your settings in a Color Scheme file. Color schemes are text files, with a. kcsrc extension, that contain entries for each window widget and its color, in RGB format. It is also very easy to add color schemes that you have downloaded by clicking on Import Scheme... and pointing to the. kcsrc file. With color schemes, you can save the changes you have done in one convenient file or easily change to a predefined color setting, without having to change each window element separately.

Well due to some magic a (not so) unique ID is automatically generated from the & CD; data when it is entered/ present in the drive. That might be the number of tracks and their length and/ or other things. See freedb. org for more information. Funny enough but unfortunately, the created ID does not seem to be unique for each & CD;. So sometimes a & CD; has to be sorted into a wrong category, out of the 11 defined by freedb, because there is already a & CD; with the same key in the database for the correct category. For backward compatibility they do n't want to change the key generation. However, that should be only exceptional.: -) Check freedb. org for the categories before submitting. For instance the category rock holds pop and rap & CD; s as well, as there does not exist a category pop or rap.

If a QIF file contains date entries with years represented with two digits then either an apostrophe or a slash may be used to delimit the year in the dates for certain centuries.

The for loop is a counting loop, & ie; it keeps count for you. The first number sets the variable to the value in the first loop. Every loop the number is increased until the second number is reached. for $x = 1 to 10 {print $x * 7 forward 15} Every time the code between the brackets is executed the $x is increased by 1, until x reaches the value of 10. The code between the brackets prints the $x multiplied by 7. After this program finishes its execution you will see the times table of 7 on the canvas.

Vorbis' audio quality is not best measured in kilobits per second, but on a scale from -1 to 10 called quality. For now, quality -1 is roughly equivalent to 45kbps average, 5 is roughly 160kbps, and 10 gives about 400kbps. Most people seeking very-near-CD-quality audio encode at a quality of 5 or, for lossless stereo coupling, 6. The quality 3 gives, at approximately 110kbps a smaller filesize and significantly better fidelity than. mp3 compression at 128kbps. This explanation is based on the one from the www. vorbis. com FAQ.

To change both at the same time, move the mouse cursor over the corner of the window. When the pointer becomes a diagonal double-headed arrow, click and drag.

This sidebar tab serves to apply and edit image attributes like captions, rating, date and tags. The attributes are stored in the associated database, in the IPTC and EXIF data fields and become part of the image. All attributes are accessible in one sidebar view as shown in the screenshot below. During image reading the order of priority is a) database b) IPTC and c) EXIF. So if there is a discrepancy between any of the three, this priority will take effect and a synchronization will take place. This sidebar has a first-previous-next-last arrow navigator field on top if shown in the main application.

The author of the downloadable NGC/ IC catalog has released it with the restriction that it may not be used commercially. For most & kstars; users, this is not a problem. However, it is technically against the & kstars; license (the GPL) to restrict usage in this way. We removed the Messier object images from the standard distribution for two reasons: to simply reduce the size of & kstars;, and also because of similar licensing concerns with a couple of the images. The inline images are significantly compressed to a very low quality from their original form, so I doubt there is a real copyright concern, but I did obtain explicit permission from the images' authors to use the few images for which there was any question about it (see README. images). Still, just to be absolutely safe, I removed them from the standard distribution, and marked the download archive as being "free for non-commercial use".
