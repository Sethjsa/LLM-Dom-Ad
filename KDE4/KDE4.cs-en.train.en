In normal view, the letters RFU represent clockwise moves of the three visible faces and LBD appear as anticlockwise moves of the hidden faces. Adding a '(apostrophe) to a letter gives the reverse of that letter's move. To move inner slices, add periods (or dots) before the letter of the nearest face.

Here you can choose to Simple Search directly or to use some keywords to specify some attributes, such as the artist name and so on. The keywords selectable are divided by their specific value. Some keywords are numeric and others are alphanumeric. You do not need to know it directly. When a keyword is numeric it will be used to search the numeric data for each track. The alphanumeric keywords are the following: album, artist, filename (including path), mountpoint (e. g. / home/ user1), filetype (you can specify mp3, ogg, flac,... and the file extensions will be matched), genre, comment, composer, directory, lyrics, title, and label. The numeric keywords are: bitrate, disc/ discnumber, length (expressed in seconds), playcount, rating, samplerate, score, size/ filesize (expressed in bytes, kbytes, and megabytes as specified in the unit for the filesize keyword), track (i. e. the track number), and year.

JPEG Chroma subsampling level (color is saved with less resolution than luminance): None =best: uses 4:4:4 ratio. Does not employ chroma subsampling at all. This preserves edges and contrasting colors, whilst adding no additional compression Medium: uses 4:2:2 ratio. Medium compression: reduces the color resolution by one-third with little to no visual difference High: use 4:1:1 ratio. High compression: suits images with soft edges but tends to alter colors Note: JPEG always uses lossy compression.

Monitor Gamma This is a tool for changing monitor gamma correction. Use the four sliders to define the gamma correction either as a single value, or separately for the red, green and blue components. You may need to correct the brightness and contrast settings of your monitor for good results. The test images help you to find proper settings. You can save them system-wide to XF86Config (root access is required for that) or to your own KDE settings. On multi head systems you can correct the gamma values separately for all screens.

& CUPS; is dependent (for its calculation of the number of pages in a job) on passing the & PostScript; through the pstops filter. (See the kivio; Flowchart on the & CUPS; filter architecture for an idea about were this filter fits into the whole printing process.) More, pstops depends for the counting on a DSC conforming (DSC is Document Structuring Conventions, a standard defined by Adobe) to be sent by the client. In most cases this is working.

Specifying this will block more generic window settings from taking effect. Apply Initially: The window property will be only set to the given value after the window is created. No further changes will be affected. Remember: The value of the window property will be remembered and every time time the window is created, the last remembered value will be applied. Force: The window property will be always forced to the given value. Apply Now: The window property will be set to the given value immediately and will not be affected later (this action will be deleted afterwards). Force temporarily: The window property will be forced to the given value until it is hidden (this action will be deleted after the window is hidden).

Increasing the noise filter parameter may help to reduce artifacts. The noise filter can range from 0-1 but values higher than 0.1 are rarely helpful. When the noise filter value is too low, e. g. 0.0 the image quality will be very poor. A useful value is 0.01. Using a high value for the noise filter will reduce the sharpening effect of the plugin.

However, this page accounting does not work for any raw printer queues (as those, by definition, do n't use any filtering on the & CUPS; host and are by-passing pstops.) Every job going through a raw queue is counted as a 1-page-job (with possibly multiple copies). This is especially true for all Jobs sent from & Microsoft; & Windows; clients via Samba to the & CUPS; server, as those jobs are already arriving in the correct format for the printer, because the clients use the original printer driver.

This area contains a CIE or chromaticity diagram. A CIE diagram is a representation of all the colors that a person with normal vision can see. This is represented by the colored sail-shaped area. In addition you will see a triangle that is superimposed on the diagram outlined in white. This triangle represents the outer boundaries of the color space of the device that is characterized by the inspected profile. This is called the device gamut. In addition there are black dots and yellow lines on the diagram. Each black dot represents one of the measurement points that were used to create this profile. The yellow line represents the amount that each point is corrected by the profile, and the direction of this correction.

Here you can add extra extensions of video files to be displayed in your Album view. Just write "xyz abc" to support files with the *. xyz and *. abc extensions. Clicking on these files will play them in an embedded KDE movie player. You can also remove file formats that are supported by default by putting a minus sign in front of the extension: e. g. "-avi" would remove all AVI files from your Album view and any trace of them in your database. They would not be deleted, just not shown in digiKam. Warning: Removing files from the database means losing all of their tags and ratings.
