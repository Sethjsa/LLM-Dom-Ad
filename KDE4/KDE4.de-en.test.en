The Refocus technique works differently from Unsharp Mask and is also unlike the Sharpen Filter which both increase the contrast of the edges of an image. Refocus rather reverses the process by which the image got blurred by the circular aperture of the camera. This method gives you as much of the original & quot; in focusquot; image as possible. Refocus uses a very powerful deconvolution algorithm that will reclaim the data that has been mixed up. In mathematical terms, blurring is usually the result of a convolution, a deconvolution will reverse the process, this is exactly what Refocus is doing. Furthermore, the FIR filter technique allows to remove much of the noise and granularity that often gets accentuated in the sharpening process of all sharpening filters.
