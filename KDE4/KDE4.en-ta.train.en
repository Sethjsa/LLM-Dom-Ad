Page Set: Choose "All Pages", "Even Pages" or "Odd Pages" if you want to print a page selection matching one of these terms. The default is "All Pages". Note: If you combine a selection of a "Page Range" with a "Page Set" of "Odd" or "Even", you will only get the odd or even pages from the originally selected page range. This is useful if you want to print a page range in duplex on a simplex-only printer. In this case you can feed the paper to the printer twice; in the first pass, select "Odd" or "Even" (depending on your printer model), in second pass select the other option. You may need to "Reverse" the output in one of the passes (depending on your printer model).

This option allows you to change the relationship between the distance that the mouse pointer moves on the screen and the relative movement of the physical device itself (which may be a mouse, trackball, or some other pointing device.) A high value for the acceleration will lead to large movements of the mouse pointer on the screen even when you only make a small movement with the physical device. Selecting very high values may result in the mouse pointer flying across the screen, making it hard to control.

If this is disabled, the selected language does not support it. If this is enabledand if you check it, then you should type accented letters on their own. If it is not checked, accented letters will be displayed with normal letters (default). For example, in Catalan, if this is unchecked and you type "o", the o and ò will be displayed in the word xenofòbia. If this option is checked, when you type "o", only "o" will be displayed and you will have to type "ò" for this letter to be displayed.

Detect recursive cycles If this is switched off, the treemap drawing will show black areas when a recursive call is made instead of drawing the recursion ad infinitum. Note that the size of black areas often will be wrong, as inside recursive cycles the cost of calls cannot be determined; the error is small, however, for false cycles (see documentation). The correct handling for cycles is to detect them and collapse all functions of a cycle into an artificial function, which is done when this option is selected. Unfortunately, with GUI applications, this often will lead to huge false cycles, making the analysis impossible; therefore, there is the option to switch this off.

Hide user ID: Checking this option will remove the keyid of the recipient from all encrypted packets. The advantage: traffic analysis of the encrypted packets cannot be performed as easily because the recipient is unknown. The disadvantage: the receiver of the encrypted packets is forced to try all secret keys before being able to decrypt the packets. This can be a lengthy process depending on the number of secret keys the receiver holds.

Satisfy (Satisfy) This directive controls whether all specified conditions must be satisfied to allow access to the resource. If set to "all", then all authentication and access control conditions must be satisfied to allow access. Setting Satisfy to "any" allows a user to gain access if the authentication or access control requirements are satisfied. For example, you might require authentication for remote access, but allow local access without authentication. The default is "all".

The SYD() function will calculate the sum-of-years digits depreciation for an asset based on its cost, salvage value, anticipated life, and a particular period. This method accelerates the rate of the depreciation, so that more depreciation expense occurs in earlier periods than in later ones. The depreciable cost is the actual cost minus the salvage value. The useful life is the number of periods (typically years) over which the asset is depreciated.

In addition it is possible to specify multiple references (names, numbers and strings) at once (\\{name1, name2,..., "string"}).
