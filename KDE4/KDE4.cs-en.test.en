If this option is checked K3b encodes the video titles in two passes. The first pass is used to gather information about the video in order to improve the distribution of bits in the second pass. The resulting video will have a higher quality using a variable bitrate. If this option is not checked K3b will create video files with a constant bitrate and a lower quality. 2-pass encoding results in a doubled encoding time.
