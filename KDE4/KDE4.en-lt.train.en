An example of an RGB combination is 255,0,0: the first value (red) is 255 and the others are 0, so this represents a bright shade of red. Each value of an RGB combination has to be in the range 0 to 255. Here a small list of some often used colors:

A vortexer serves to homogenize reagents found in laboratories. The container containing liquid to be homogenized is put on a platform. The platform shakes by rotary agitation up to 3000RPM at which point a contact sensor is activated. In this way extremely small volumes of fluid can be homogenized quickly. It is the opposite of a centrifuge, used to separate fluids.

Note that in different countries touch typing is taught slightly different which usually affects only the top row of keys. For instance, in the United States only the leftmost key and the key with the 1 are pressed by the little finger of the left hand. In Germany the little finger also presses the 2 key, and thus the fingers shift one key to the right on the top row. Normally this only makes a difference for split or ergonomic keyboards.

Vorbis' audio quality is not best measured in kilobits per second, but on a scale from -1 to 10 called "quality". For now, quality -1 is roughly equivalent to 45kbps average, 5 is roughly 160kbps, and 10 gives about 400kbps. Most people seeking very-near-CD-quality audio encode at a quality of 5 or, for lossless stereo coupling, 6. The default setting is quality 3, which at approximately 110kbps gives a smaller filesize and significantly better fidelity than. mp3 compression at 128kbps. This explanation was copied from the www. vorbis. com FAQ.

You can choose any name, as long as it does not already have a meaning. For instance you cannot name a function forward, since that name is already used for an internal command. # here forward is used as a new command, # but it already has a meaning so # this will produce an error: learn forward {print "this is invalid"} # this works: learn myforward {print "this is ok"} Names can contain only letters, numbers and underscores (_). Yet they have to start with a letter. Container names have to start with the container prefix ($).

Screen Saver This module allows you to enable and configure a screen saver. Note that you can enable a screen saver even if you have power saving features enabled for your display. Besides providing an endless variety of entertainment and preventing monitor burn-in, a screen saver also gives you a simple way to lock your display if you are going to leave it unattended for a while. If you want the screen saver to lock the session, make sure you enable the "Require password" feature of the screen saver; if you do not, you can still explicitly lock the session using the desktop's "Lock Session" action.

Messages sometimes come in both formats. This option controls whether you want the HTML part or the plain text part to be displayed. Displaying the HTML part makes the message look better, but at the same time increases the risk of security holes being exploited. Displaying the plain text part loses much of the message's formatting, but makes it almost impossible to exploit security holes in the HTML renderer (Konqueror). The option below guards against one common misuse of HTML messages, but it cannot guard against security issues that were not known at the time this version of KMail was written. It is therefore advisable to not prefer HTML to plain text. Note: You can set this option on a per-folder basis from the Folder menu of KMail's main window.

A single shortcut can be easily assigned or cleared using the two buttons. Only shortcuts with modifiers can be used. It is possible to have several possible shortcuts, and the first available shortcut will be used. The shortcuts are specified using space-separated shortcut sets. One set is specified as base+(list), where base are modifiers and list is a list of keys. For example "Shift+Alt+(123) Shift+Ctrl+(ABC)" will first try Shift+Alt+1, then others with Shift+Ctrl+C as the last one.
