If this option is checked, K3b enables Burnfree (or Just Link). This is a feature of the CD writer which avoids buffer underruns. Without burnfree, if the writer cannot get any more data a buffer underrun would occur, since the writer needs a constant stream of data to write the CD. With burnfree the writer can mark the current position of the laser and get back to it when the buffer is filled again; but, since this means having little data gaps on the CD, it is highly recommended to always choose an appropriate writing speed to prevent the usage of burnfree, especially for audio CDs (in the worst case one would hear the gap). Burnfree was formerly known as Burnproof, but has since been renamed when it became part of the MMC standard.

Every picture on a physical medium is composed of a pattern of discrete dots in different colors and (maybe) sizes. This is called a "raster image". This is as opposed to a "vector image" where the graphic is described in terms of continuous curves, shades, forms and filled areas, represented by mathematical formula. Vector images normally have a smaller file size and may be scaled in size without any loss of information and quality --- but they cannot be output directly, but always have to be "rendered" or "rasterized" first to the given resolution that the output device is capable of... The rasterization is done by a Raster Image Processor (RIP, often the Ghostscript software) or some other filtering instance.

Job Priority Usually CUPS prints all jobs per queue according to the "FIFO" principle: First In, First Out. The job priority option allows you to re-order the queue according to your needs. It works in both directions: you can increase as well as decrease priorities. (Usually you can only control your own jobs.) Since the default job priority is "50", any job sent with, for example, "49" will be printed only after all those others have finished. Conversely, a "51" or higher priority job will go right to the top of a populated queue (if no other, higher prioritized one is present.) Additional hint for power users: This KDEPrint GUI element corresponds to the CUPS command line job option parameter: -o job-priority=... # example: "10" or "66" or "99"

During startup KDE needs to perform a check of its system configuration (mimetypes, installed applications, etc.), and in case the configuration has changed since the last time, the system configuration cache (KSyCoCa) needs to be updated. This option delays the check, which avoid scanning all directories containing files describing the system during KDE startup, thus making KDE startup faster. However, in the rare case the system configuration has changed since the last time, and the change is needed before this delayed check takes place, this option may lead to various problems (missing applications in the K Menu, reports from applications about missing required mimetypes, etc.). Changes of system configuration mostly happen by (un)installing applications. It is therefore recommended to turn this option temporarily off while (un)installing applications.

Gopher is an Internet information browsing service that uses a menu-driven interface. Users select information from menus, which may return another menu or display a text file. An item may reside on a Gopher server you originally queried, or it may be on another Gopher server (or another host). Gopher can tunnel from one Gopher to another without the user knowing that the server and/ or host machine have changed. Gopher keeps the exact location of computers hidden from the user, providing the illusion of a single, large set of interconnected menus.

This is the second flavor of traditional & UNIX; printing (as opposed to BSD-style printing). It uses a different command set (lp, lpadmin,...) to BSD, but is not fundamentally different from it. However, the gap between the two is big enough to make the two incompatible, so that a BSD-client cannot simply print to a System V style print server without additional tweaking... IPP is supposed to resolve this weakness and more.

Abbreviation for R aster I mage P rocess(or); if used in the context of printing, "RIP" means a hardware or software instance that converts & PostScript; (or other print formats that are represented in one of the non-Raster PDLs) into a raster image format in such a way that it is acceptable for the "marking engine" of the printer. & PostScript; printers contain their own PostScript-RIPs. A RIP may or may not be located inside a printer. For many & UNIX; systems, Ghostscript is the package that provides a "RIP in software", running on the host computer, and pre-digesting the & PostScript; or other data to become ready to be sent to the printing device (hence you may perceive a "grain of truth" in the slogan "Ghostscript turns your printer into a & PostScript; machine", which of course is not correct in the true sense of the meaning).

Screen Saver This module allows you to enable and configure a screen saver. Note that you can enable a screen saver even if you have power saving features enabled for your display. Besides providing an endless variety of entertainment and preventing monitor burn-in, a screen saver also gives you a simple way to lock your display if you are going to leave it unattended for a while. If you want the screen saver to lock the session, make sure you enable the "Require password" feature of the screen saver; if you do not, you can still explicitly lock the session using the desktop's "Lock Session" action.
