This selects which mailbox format will be the default for local folders: mbox: KMail's mail folders are represented by a single file each. Individual messages are separated from each other by a line starting with "From". This saves space on disk, but may be less robust, e. g. when moving messages between folders. maildir: KMail's mail folders are represented by real folders on disk. Individual messages are separate files. This may waste a bit of space on disk, but should be more robust, e. g. when moving messages between folders.

On an audio CD each track (except for the last) can have a post-gap. This does not mean that K3b adds an additional gap of silence to the track. This setting simply influences the display on a Hifi audio CD player. The part of an audio track that is marked as post-gap is counted backwards. This setting is irrelevant for most users as modern CD burners can put arbitrary audio data in the post-gap when burning in DAO mode. In other CD-burning applications the post-gap might be called the pre-gap. The pre-gap of track 2 is the same as the post-gap of track 1. Changing the post-gap does not change the length of the track. When writing in TAO writing mode (not recommended for Audio CDs) the post-gap will most likely be muted and on some burners forced to 2 seconds.

The term given this missing mass is Dark Matter, and those two words pretty well sum up everything we know about it at this point. We know there is Matter, because we can see the effects of its gravitational influence. However, the matter emits no detectable electromagnetic radiation at all, hence it is Dark. There exist several theories to account for the missing mass ranging from exotic subatomic particles, to a population of isolated black holes, to less exotic brown and white dwarfs. The term missing mass might be misleading, since the mass itself is not missing, just its light. But what is exactly dark matter and how do we really know it exists, if we cannot see it?

When creating a project you can opt to copy to your local project, all the existing global and user templates. Legacy project get default templating abilities so nothing is lost. You can choose where to locate your template files so they can be in your server root and easy to upload or you can make them secure to link to below server root which is a very cool trick. When linking to a file not in the project templates you will be prompted to copy the file to the project templates prior to linking. This will prevent broken links on upload. You always have control where you place your templates so you can choose to move them. However & quantaplus; does not track this so you will need to change links.

Other revision control systems - like RCS and SourceSafe use a different model. When a developer wants to a edit a file, he has to lock it. Only one developer at a time can a lock a file. When he has finished editing, the lock is released. On the one hand, with this model, conflicts can never happen. On the other hand, two developers cannot work on the same file at the same time, even when their changes do not affect each other. This can be a bottleneck. We are not going to discuss the organizational benefits of both approaches. Nevertheless we mention that although & CVS; has some support for locking, it is not the preferred way of working with & CVS;. You should not use these features unless you are sure that your project manager allows them.

ASCII TAB is the most widely used tabulature format in the Internet, there are numerous archives that host tabulatures in this format. It consists of a plain text file in which the tabulature is depicted using staves (with minus characters), numbers (digit characters) and effects (with various letters). Among them there could be occasional texts, playing directions, etc. There's no single standard for ASCII tabs, so sometimes it may be a hell amount of work to comprehend a screwed tabulature. Lots of information is often missing from ASCII tabs, most often - the rhythm and note durations information, that makes plainly impossible to play that tabulature if you've never heard the song before (and even if you did, it is n't always very clear how to do it).

This may sound odd, (why playing a trumpet when the song is made to play a piano?), but it is very useful. The GM standard specifies that when a midi keyboard receives an event to change patch to 0, it will change the current patch to Grand Piano, but older synthesizer will change for example to a Electric Guitar when it receives a 0. This old keyboard, needed to receive a 3 (for example) to change to a Piano. And here comes the midi map in action, changing all change patch to 0 to change patch to 3 and thus really playing the correct instrument when it has to.

Syntax Highlighting is what makes the editor automatically display text in different styles/ colors, depending on the function of the string in relation to the purpose of the file. In program source code for example, control statements may be rendered bold, while data types and comments get different colors from the rest of the text. This greatly enhances the readability of the text, and thus helps the author to be more efficient and productive.

When the MapExpressionToVolumeEvents option is set in the map file, and a midi file try to send an expression event, & kmid; will send a volume event which is understood by more non-GM keyboards, and which has a similar effect. There are many midi files which use expression events to fade out at the end of a song, so if you feel that music should be heard softer and softer, you can turn on this option and see if this is what you need, because your midi synthesizer could be ignoring the expression events because it does n't understand them.

Another phenomenon that suggested the need for dark matter is the rotational curves of Spiral Galaxies. Spiral Galaxies contain a large population of stars that orbit the Galactic center on nearly circular orbits, much like planets orbit a star. Like planetary orbits, stars with larger galactic orbits are expected to have slower orbital speeds (this is just a statement of Kepler's 3rd Law). Actually, Kepler's 3rd Law only applies to stars near the perimeter of a Spiral Galaxy, because it assumes the mass enclosed by the orbit to be constant.

Which sizes will be offered by the icon size listbox depends on the icon theme you have selected in the icon themes control module. For example, the low color icon theme only offers the sizes 16 and 32 for desktop icons and 16, 22 and 32 for toolbar icons. The HiColor theme offers icon sizes 16, 32 and 48 as well as sizes from 64 to 128. However, as & kde; can not have all these icon sizes in store, icons using size 64 to 128 will be automatically generated which may result in a loss of quality.

For example, the star Bellatrix in Orion has Fb/ Fv = 1.22, indicating that it is brighter through the B filter than through the V filter. furthermore, its Fu/ Fb ratio is 2.22, so it is brightest through the U filter. This indicates that the star must be very hot indeed, since the position of its spectral peak must be somewhere in the range of the U filter, or at an even shorter wavelength. The surface temperature of Bellatrix (as determined from comparing its spectrum to detailed models that account for its absorption lines) is about 25,000 Kelvin.

An icon theme contains the images used to represent actions, files, devices, and applications. Managing icon themes is easily done through the Icons module in the & kcontrolcenter;. Simply select the icon theme you want to use and click on Apply to switch to the new theme. To install new icon themes, all you need to do is to click on Install New Theme... and browse to the location of the icon theme archive.

To remove an icon theme, simply select the theme from the list and click on Remove Theme. Note that you cannot remove the icon theme that you are currently using. You need to switch to some other theme before the current one will become removable. You also cannot remove icon themes that were installed by the administrator (root) or by your distribution's package manager.

2500 years ago, the ancient Greek astronomer Hipparchus classified the brightnesses of visible stars in the sky on a scale from 1 to 6. He called the very brightest stars in the sky first magnitude, and the very faintest stars he could see sixth magnitude. Amazingly, two and a half millenia later, Hipparchus's classification scheme is still widely used by astronomers, although it has since been modernized and quantified.

Then, the setting can be added underneath the group name.

This bar gets its name from the function (FN) keys it represents. For each button on this bar there is a corresponding function key that performs the same action. This bar is derived from the design of the first twin-panel file managers and the FN keys usually act the same way with two changes: the F2 key will open a terminal at the last local path that the active panel pointed to, and the F9 key is used to rename files. Mkdir F7 can create whole directory trees on the fly & eg; foo/ bar/ test. You can choose to display or not the FN keys bar when starting up & krusader; via the Konfigurator Startup page, and you can toggle its use in the current session with the Settings menu. The actions and Key-Bindings performed by the function keys are configurable since version 1.51, they will remain active with or without the FN keys bar displayed.

Once dealing is finished each player ends up with 16 cards each. Cards are displayed in two vertical rows - four cards per row. Half of the cards are face down and half are face up. As a player you can see the cards of your opponent as well as your own. You can make a move then by clicking on any of your cards which are currently face up. The opponent has to reply by choosing a corresponding card form his/ her own stack. Note If your opponent is artificial intelligence, its cards will be chosen automatically. Once the exchange is finished values of the played cards are evaluated and either you or your opponent is awarded points. The game is complete in 16 rounds (when all of your and your opponent's cards have been played). After the game ends your score is being compared to that of your opponent and the player with the higher score wins the round.

Set here the ISO-sensitivity of the simulated infrared film. Increasing this value will increase the proportion of green color in the mix. It will also increase the halo effect on the highlights, and the film graininess (if that box is checked). Note: to simulate an Ilford SFX200 infrared film, use a sensitivity excursion of 200 to 800. A sensitivity over 800 simulates Kodak HIE high-speed infrared film. This last one creates a more dramatic photographic style.

Some rules allow the optional attribute dynamic of type boolean that defaults to false. If dynamic is true, a rule can use placeholders representing the text matched by a regular expression rule that switched to the current context in its string or char attributes. In a string, the placeholder %N (where N is a number) will be replaced with the corresponding capture N from the calling regular expression. In a char the placeholder must be a number N and it will be replaced with the first character of the corresponding capture N from the calling regular expression. Whenever a rule allows this attribute it will contain a (dynamic).

A basic requirement for studying the heavens is determining where in the sky things are. To specify sky positions, astronomers have developed several coordinate systems. Each uses a coordinate grid projected on the Celestial Sphere, in analogy to the Geographic coordinate system used on the surface of the Earth. The coordinate systems differ only in their choice of the fundamental plane, which divides the sky into two equal hemispheres along a great circle. (the fundamental plane of the geographic system is the Earth's equator). Each coordinate system is named for its choice of fundamental plane.

When this option is chosen, moving the cursor with the arrow keys off the end of a line (to the right) causes it to jump down to the beginning of the next line. Likewise when the cursor is moved past the beginning of a line (to the left) it jumps up to the end of the preceding line. When this option is not selected, moving the cursor right past the end of a line merely causes it to continue horizontally in the same line and trying to move it left past the beginning does nothing.

& blinken; is based on an electronic game released in 1978, which challenges players to remember sequences of increasing length. On the face of the device, there are 4 different color buttons, each one with their own distinctive sound. These buttons light up randomly, creating the sequence that the player must then recall. If the player is successful in remembering the sequence of lights in the correct order, they advance to the next stage, where an identical sequence with one extra step is presented. If they are incorrect, the game is lost, and the player must start again from the beginning. The goal is to get a high score - each step in the sequence is worth one point, so correct entry of a sequence of 8 lights is worth 8 points on the high score table.

Insecure locks This option tells the NFS server not to require authentication of locking requests (i. e. requests which use the NLM protocol). Normally the NFS server will require a lock request to hold a credential for a user who has read access to the file. With this flag no access checks will be performed. Early NFS client implementations did not send credentials with lock requests, and many current NFS clients still exist which are based on the old implementations. Use this flag if you find that you can only lock files which are world readable.
